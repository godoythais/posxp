        "Texto": "TLDR: Seeking advice from others who love running, but their body doesn't always agree. \n\nStory version: Running was my (33F) first love. I feel like I non-stopped ran/played as a child. Then, in middle school I started running the mile and 800m competitively. I was good and I loved it. When I got to high school, I started running cross country and continued to excel. But, then, I got hurt. I ran so much that I got a stress fracture in my shin. I had an MRI and then PT, and then custom orthotic for my right shoe. I had to stop running for a bit. I came back and was never the same. I went from 6-7 minute miles to 10 minute miles. Since then, I've run on and off. I still love running, but it seems every time I get in the groove (running 3+ times/week), I get injured. I'm constantly battling the shin splints and occasionally have had other issues such as IT band and foot pain. I wear stability shoes because of my hx of problems. I do all the things - strength work, balancing work, stretching, ab work, building up, etc. I'd love to be able to run far and even train for a 5k - 10k again. Right now, I'm doing about 2.5 miles several times a week and feel the shin splints again (on both legs). \n\nI'm wondering if there are any others who've had a similar experience? Is this just the way it goes for some people? Do you just do it on and off for the rest of time? It bums me out to love something so much that doesn't love me back hahaha. ",

        "Texto": "When I returned to running I was prescribed Stability shoes (Mizuno Wave Inspire 19's) for mild pronation in one foot. They worked fine, but since then I've been rotating 6 neutral shoes for a year without issue. I'm a forefoot runner so I wonder if stability is even a factor for me. Sometimes I do feel some ankle weakness and fatigue on long runs or if i'm tired and thought about adding in some stability into the rotation some days. I have never felt \"unstable\" so what signs do you look for for needing more stability?",

        "Texto": "# Race Information\n\n* **Name:** Barcelona Marathon\n* **Date:** March 16, 2025\n* **Distance:** 42,195km\n* **Location:** Barcelona, Spain\n* **Time:** 3:55 ( 5:28min/km )\n\n# Goals\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A|3:45 ( 5:20min/km )|*No*|\n|B|Finishing|*Yes*|\n\n# Background\n\nThis is the third time I attempt running an standalone Marathon, the same one in fact. I tried in 2019, but I was already injured so I could only run until km 30 ( ILB injury, and also underfueled ), and tried again at 2020 but it was canceled because of COVID one week before. After training twice I said I would never prepare an standalone marathon again because the training was extremely boring for me and I also liked cycling.\n\nI already did the Ironman one in 2021, but it was more like a walkathon at 4:50 and I had several issues that day, so for me its not the same. I did 4 half ironmans before.\n\nI didnt do any sport until 2015, I was very overweight at 28years old at 150kg and I had to change my lifestyle. I learned how to swim, cycle and I eventually did triathlons. But I was never fast or anything. My 10k PB is 44min at 2020, few months before COVID kicked in.\n\nAfter the ironman, which I prepared and did without a single injury, I took a break from running for a few months to recover, and once I came back, I started feeling pain on my Aquiles, which I thought it was just cramps. By then I was at 90kg aprox and I kept it between 95-100 until last year, at 183cm height.\n\nAfter weeks/months, the pain was growing more and more, not while running, but hours and the day after. I went to several PT, doctors and podologists and they told me I had a tendinopathy. I did several treatments, tried different shoes, did rehab and spent a ton of money on ortothics for nearly 6 months and the thing only got  worse. I then decided to stop running and focusing on cycling, because it was what I liked the most. Also, it didnt matter if I ran fast or slow, 5km or 15km, the pain was the same.\n\nSo I basically didnt run at all between 2022 and 2024, but I became even stronger cycling ( I was already okish then ) and doing 6-7hrs ride at decent paces and elevation was a normal thing for me. I really liked spending the whole day outside and doing 200+km in one sitting. I also was doing 1-2 days of strength conditioning weekly.\n\nI learned a lot about pacing, fueling and all that stuff. And around july last year, to help me loose more weight I decided to try again, so I went back doing walk-running and shorter 20-30minutes. The pain was gone, at least for such short efforts. After a month or two, I could do 10-12km pain free, and I said, ok, lets sign up for a half marathon and see how it goes. I did it, pain free, and almost the same time as my PB ( 1:48 vs 1:44 ) several years ago.\n\nAs I was enjoying quite a lot running, I decided, for the last time, to try finishing a marathon.\n\nI used to run with Asics, but this time I found a pair of somewhat cheap shoes ( Nike Zoom Structure,  cheaper compared to others I used before ) that fitted me perfectly, gave me no pain and no blisters or anything. I bought 3 pairs ( two of them on a sale ) and rotated them during these last months\n\n# Training\n\nUntil then, all the competitions I did, either running, cycling or triathlons, was with the help of a coach, not always the same, and I changed a few times. This time, as I didnt really care on times or anything much, I decided to go on my own. On my mind, the only deal I had is \"Ill prepare it until I feel pain, the first moment I feel pain ill stop and not try running again\"\n\nI had some experience in long distance and I was well aware that my main issue was the risk of getting injured, so I was not really looking forward of doing intervals or anything. I prepared a plan for myself of about 16 weeks, with 3 of increasing mileage and one with less and resting. Seeing this, I committed to ONLY running three times per week ( Tuesday, Thursday, and Sat/Sun, depending on week ), but instead adding quite a lot of cycling in between, to help with aerobic fitness without injury risk, specially in the first 10-12 weeks.\n\nI found 2 half marathons that had good dates so I could test myself, specially in terms of fueling.\n\nSome friends told me that running just 3 weeks wasnt enough, that I was going to lack mileage, while others told me it was ok. But I didnt care, I knew injury risk was a thing. Same with intervals, last time I got injured while doing them so I neglected them completely.\n\nMost of my training has been at paces around 6min/km, but mostly because I was running by HR instead. I did some progressive runs until week 10-11, to simulate fatigue, and was bouncing between resting pace or tempo. The closer the last test ( the 30km long run ) my long runs were faster and approaching my target pace. On the tapering weeks I went very easy and slowed then in general on purpose.\n\nMidweek days I started doing between 8-10km per day, followed by 60-90min easy cycling right after, which I felt It helped me also to recover in terms of muscle fatigue, and a long run on the weekends. As weeks passed I increased the distance and I was doing 14/15km per run plus the longer one on the weekend.\n\nIn the end, the week I did the most mileage was 66km, while I averaged 55km more or less. The first weeks I was doing 30-35 while the last 3 were around 60-66, including the 30km long run test. In terms of cycling, I was averaging 200-250km per week on the first 10 weeks, and around 80-150km on the later. I did 2 weeks of tapering, going down from 66km to 48, 35 and 18 on race week, excluding marathon.\n\nI did a 10k race by week 4 at higher than usual bpm ( 165ish ) and I clocked 47min, while on the half marathons I did 1:48 on each one of them, at an average 150-155bpm heart rate. On the second half marathon, I went cycling for almost 3hours on the same evening, without feeling exhausted or tired.\n\nI did the 30km test at 5:10 and 150bpm heart rate, and I finished strong, so my target was a little bit slower than that.\n\nI knew strength training was very important and knowing my past injuries, I had to put a lot of care into core, glue, quads and hips, so I focused most of my routine on that, based on agiliy rather than building muscle, so lots of repetitions with mid/low weight.\n\nI had zero injuries, pain or anything. It was by far, speaking about feelings, the best marathon prep I did. Even doing way less cycling than when I prepared the Ironman, I was much stronger. On the second prep, which I had faster 10k times, I did worse on the 30km and I felt much more tired overall due to the interval sessions I was doing and running 5 days per week which much less cycling. I also was able to go down to 86ish kilos, which has been probably my lowest weight ever since I started doing sports\n\n# Race day\n\nOr better said, race week :\\_)\n\nHere in Spain we have had rain for more than a month, and its been quite a cold winter. I did the first half marathon sick with flu, cough and whatever. And unfortunately, the week before race day I got another flu, but this time without fever, just coughing and mucus.\n\nThe days were passing and I wasnt feeling any better. The same morning I spent 30 minutes coughing at home. 10 minutes before the race started, I started coughing again and I ended up puking while I went to the toilet. I had issues breathing and if I started coughing it was hard to stop.\n\nI was with some friends, and I was seriously thinking on not even starting. As the circuit was quite condensed, and I really wanted to run, I decided to start and see how it went, with the thought of stopping if I was feeling too bad. Maybe it was not a wise decision, but I knew I would stop ASAP if things went too bad, so I decided to try.\n\nAfter 3h and 55 minutes I finished, at a slightly slower pace than expected. If I tried running faster I started coughing and I didnt want to puke right in the middle, as it could be risky.\n\nI enjoyed the race a lot even at my not ideal condition, I slightly slowed down on the aid stations to grab water and a bit after km 35 because my HR started spiking and I wanted to avoid coughing.\n\nNo pain while running, and the day after I only had slight cramps, and as of today, I feel completely recovered, compared to other races I did in the past.\n\nIm very very happy, because I started all of this with zero pressure, just running for the sake of running, and I enjoyed every single run and day I went out. When I did the first two tries, I was really dreading some days. Running more days could have helped me? I think so, but as I said, my main goal was avoiding injury :)\n\nNext year Ill probably run the marathon again, hopefully with better luck!",

I ran it in the closest thing I had to running shoes which was Altra S trail shoes (that immediately untied upon me leaving the starting line, but that's my fault not the shoes). I was pretty hung over on that race day since we had Friendsgiving at our place the night before, but I surprised myself with what I considered a solid performance averaging about 8:35/mi pace essentially off the couch. My running history at that time consisted of playing high school soccer for a couple years, then pick-up soccer here and there for some years thereafter, and running one random 5k 13 years ago. However, I am generally a pretty fit guy and have hiked a ton and played various sports throughout my life and like to stay active, so I was working with a favorable baseline.\n\nHanging out post-race, it was decided by our running friend group that the next running objective needs to be identified immediately, and Tobacco Road Half some 4 months later was deemed an appropriate target.\n\n# Training\n\nI had no idea what I was getting into, and my ego is a bit out of control, so I couldn't settle for just merely completing the race and had to find a difficult yet achievable goal. After googling various pathetic things such as \"what's a good half marathon time\" and \"how hard is x time in half marathon\", I settled on 1:45 as a reasonable goal, and picked the RW's 12-week Sub 1:45 Half-Marathon Plan (https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/half-marathon/a760103/rws-12-week-sub-145-half-marathon-schedules/) for no other reason than it had a suitable time frame and formatting looked neat. Now... the header for the plan says \"Target times: from 1:30 to 1:44 (race pace: sub-8:00 per mile). You should be capable of either a sub-46 10K, sub-1:18 10-miler or a sub-4:00 marathon. Training will be at least five days a week, with an average weekly mileage of 35 miles.\" I did not really meet these requirements, but ignored that part and plowed ahead anyway. I also ignored the fact that I was starting from 0, rather than 20mpw base fitness like the plan called for.\n\nWhat my actual training mileage was: 5 weeks of 10-15 MPW as I was ramping up from basically nothing... and 7 weeks of 20-33 MPW (only one week exceeded 30 miles). I dropped every single fartlek run from the training (just rested or cross-trained instead) because I didn't really understand what fartlek was and I was just not ready for that sort of mileage. So essentially the plan ended up becoming a blend of building base fitness and slowly \"meeting\" the plan around week 7 where I did almost every workout as written (except fartlek runs and dialing back long run mileage)\n\nNow here are my thoughts on this plan. I have no idea if this plan is good for getting a 1:30 Half, but for me personally it was a huge overkill for simply sub 1:45. If you're able to meet the various speed benchmarks sprinkled throughout the plan like I was, you don't need to exceed 20-25MPW at any point. 1:30-1:45 is a huge difference in running fitness, and approaches to achieving those times should be quite different. Of course I only know this now after the fact, though I intuitively began to understand that I didn't need all that mileage around week 8.\n\nMy A-B-C goals swung wildly back and forth depending on my delusion at the time or how I felt about how the training was going, but I eventually settled on 1:40 as my A-goal, and I still believe that should everything had gone right in terms of weather and pacing I am capable of this goal with no additional training.\n\n# The Course / The Event\n\nTobacco Road Half/Full is advertized as \"flat and fast\" and is a BQ race, so it's a pretty big deal around these parts.  The half course is an out and back with \\~5 miles on road and the rest on hard packed gravel lined by tall pines. The event is incredibly well-organized and generally loved by locals, so nothing negative to say in this regard.\n\n# Race Day\n\nNearly all of my training was done in 30-50 degree weather. I love running in the cold, and training over the winter really appealed to me. However, the actual race happened to be on a warm, humid, windy morning preceding a massive thunderstorm so the conditions were quite different from what I was used to, and I was genuinely concerned that my body was completely unprepared for such comfort zone deviation. Another unfortunate fact about the Tobacco Road Half/Full is that it starts at the ass early time of 7:00am and because of the complicated parking and shuttling situation, I had to wake up at 4:15am to ensure a stress free experience getting to the race site. With all of that said, I arrived at the race site fairly well-rested after a perfectly executed weekend-long nutrition/relaxation/physical-prep plan and had plenty of time for multuple porta-potty breaks, mulch naps, and taking in the pre-race atmosphere.\n\n# The Race\n\nThe race had pacers in increments of 15 minutes for the half, and so obviously I lined up with the 1:45 guys. I slurped a goo, re-tied my shoes, and excitedly waited for the gun. My plan was to follow the pacer for the first mile no matter what, and then slowly run away from them while flawlessly performing negative splitting for the rest of the race. The one problem with that plan was that I am fucking awful at pacing myself so while my first paced split was an ideal 7:56, my second (first independent) split was 7:19. The slow-motion catastrophe continued with the next three miles all clocking in under 7:30, but I have to say that the first 5 miles felt fantastic as I was finding my breath and enjoying the weather more than I thought I would. During mile 6 the nightmarish realization finally set in.... this was not my half marathon pace, this was my 10k pace, and my body was expecting this run to conclude accordingly. I began to panic. I dropped back from the highly experienced runner dude I was following and engaged in crisis management mode. I did my best to drop to a pace that felt tangibly easier yet within parameters of achieving my A goal. I rounded the halfway mark at exactly 50:00, but my body was not ready to repeat the effort it just undertook. The first half of my run can be best described as an exhilarating romp, the second half as a white-knuckling painful slog. Miles 7-10 were spent in borderline delirium as I desperately tried to cling on to runner after runner to help me pace myself just to inevitably have them leave me behind. My eyelids began to droop, breath became erratic, I felt my heartbeat in my scalp, my chin occasionally dropped to my chest. I felt like I was in the last stretch of a 5k, and had 5 miles left to go. Miles 10 and 11 were the most miserable running I ever endured. No amount of crowd encouragement, mental gymnastics, positive self-talk, or cadence reset trickery seemed to dimish the agony. One thing that seemed to help was occasionally talking to other runners, but not all were open to chatting. And yet I refused to significantly slow down. I notched two splits above 8 minutes in miles 10 and 13 (where we had to run for a mile into a ripping headwind), but the rest were under 8. I accelerated the best I could toward the finish gate and clocked a net time of just around 1:42.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nI think my ultimate goal was achievable with more preferable weather and better pacing, basically should everything had gone right, so it makes sense that I fell short. I am still proud of my training and performance, and will likely try to run another race soon after I've had time to process and re-evaluate my fitness goals.\n\n",

I’ve been consistently weightlifting for the past 3.5 years, focusing on strength training and muscle development. While I’ve always enjoyed lifting, I never really liked cardio and avoided it for the most part.\n\nIn June 2024, I decided to give running a try but only ran once or twice a month, never going beyond 3 miles at a time. Running felt like more of a challenge than something I enjoyed, so I wasn’t consistent with it. However, in November 2024, I joined a run club to push myself and be part of a supportive community. We started a structured 20-week training program to train for the Rose Bowl Half and LAM.\n\nSince then, I’ve been working on gradually increasing my mileage, improving my pace, and learning how to balance running with my strength training routine. My goal is to become a stronger, more efficient runner while maintaining my muscle and overall fitness.\n\n\r  \nTraining:\n\nWhen I first joined my run club and started training, my plan was simple: train for the Rose Bowl Half Marathon first and see how I felt before even considering a full marathon. As an inexperienced runner, the thought of running 26.2 miles felt impossible. A half marathon already seemed like a massive undertaking, so I didn’t even entertain the idea of signing up for the full race.\n\nInjury Setback: IT Band Syndrome\n\nAround six weeks into training, I started dealing with a pretty bad IT band injury. Looking back, it was a combination of factors:\n\nPushing my pace too much instead of focusing on building endurance\n\nImbalanced muscle strength, where my hip flexors were weak compared to my quads, glutes, and hamstrings\n\nLack of mobility and stabilization work, which put extra strain on my knees\n\nThe pain made it nearly impossible to run without discomfort, and I knew I had to take a few weeks off to avoid making it worse.\n\nWildfires & Delayed Training\n\nJust as I was hoping to get back on track, wildfires in January forced another training delay. The air quality was terrible, and it wasn’t safe to run outdoors. On top of that, the Rose Bowl Half Marathon got postponed, meaning my original goal race was no longer happening before the marathon.\n\nDuring this period of limited training, I started feeling FOMO as I watched other girls in my run club ramp up their mileage for the full marathon. The idea of running 26.2 miles, which had once felt so intimidating, now seemed like something I might actually be able to attempt—if I could get my injury under control.\n\nPhysical Therapy & Progress\n\nTo address my IT band issues, I started going to physical therapy, focusing on:\n\nStrengthening my hip flexors and glutes\n\nStability exercises to improve my knee alignment\n\nTargeted mobility work to relieve tightness in my IT band\n\nEach week, I saw small but significant progress. The pain didn’t disappear overnight, but I could run a little longer each time before discomfort set in.\n\nThe Decision to Run the Full Marathon\n\nBy this point, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to fully catch up in my training plan, but I still decided to sign up for the marathon before it sold out. The idea of finishing my first marathon—even if it wouldn’t be perfect—was too tempting to pass up.\n\nI did my best to increase my mileage gradually, balancing injury prevention with pushing myself just enough to be prepared. I knew I wasn’t going to have the ideal training cycle, but I reminded myself that some training was always better than none—and if people could finish marathons with zero training, I at least had a shot.\n\nTraining Stats & Race Shoes\n\nLongest run: 13.1 miles @ 12:45 pace\n\nTotal training mileage: ~200 miles\n\nPeak weekly mileage: 21 miles\n\nAverage pace for shorter runs: 10:31\n\nI trained in my Saucony Endorphin Speed 4s, and they felt great for most of the cycle. But towards the end, I started getting arch pain, which made me nervous. By the time I noticed the issue, it was too late to switch anything—so I just had to hope that race day adrenaline would carry me through.\n\nI went into the marathon nervous but determined. I knew my training hadn’t been ideal, but I also knew I had put in enough effort to at least give myself a chance to cross that finish line.\n\nRace Week: Tapering, Carb Loading, and Recovery\n\nSeven days before race day, I began my taper, significantly reducing my mileage and intensity to allow my body to recover fully. My focus shifted toward maximizing recovery, ensuring I was well-rested and primed for race day.\n\nThree days before the race, I ramped up my carbohydrate intake, aiming for at least 400g+ of carbs per day to ensure my glycogen stores were fully replenished. I prioritized easy-to-digest, high-carb foods like rice, pasta, bread, and fruit while keeping my protein and fat intake moderate to avoid feeling sluggish.\n\nTwo days before the race, I started increasing my electrolyte intake, making sure I was well-hydrated and that my sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels were optimized.\n\nI dedicated the entire race week to recovery and mobility work, focusing on compression boots, myofascial release, and light stretching to keep my legs fresh. I also took a couple of yoga classes to promote relaxation and mobility while ensuring I wasn’t doing anything too strenuous \n\nShakeout Run: LA 5K Experience\n\nThe day before the marathon, I participated in the LA 5K as my shakeout run, keeping it at a light jog/walk pace to avoid unnecessary fatigue. This was less about performance and more about getting my body moving, easing any pre-race nerves, and soaking in the race-day atmosphere. The energy of the event was incredible, and being surrounded by other runners added to the excitement. Plus, the bonus medal was a nice incentive!\n\nNight Before the Race\n\nI made sure to eat my final meal by 6 PM, keeping it simple, carb-heavy, and easy to digest—something I knew wouldn’t upset my stomach. After dinner, I got into bed by 7 PM, knowing I needed as much rest as possible.\n\nAt 12 AM, I woke up, partially from excitement and partially because I needed to use the restroom. My alarm was originally set for 1 AM, but since I was already awake, I just laid in bed, trying to relax and focus on my breath, even though I couldn't fully fall back asleep.\n\nRace Morning: Early Start & Shuttle to Dodger Stadium\n\nAt 4 AM, I left the house, making the drive from the SFV to Century City, where I had pre-planned parking.The drive over is typically about 25 minutes, on race morning the traffic wasn't too bad around that time, the most difficult thing was navigating the road closures. By 4:50 AM, I was parked and got in line for the shuttles, the lines were long but moved quickly and by 5:15 AM, I was on the shuttle, heading toward Dodger Stadium.\n\nThe shuttle ride was smooth, and getting into the stadium was effortless. As soon as I arrived, I checked my bag at the gear check station made a final stop at the restroom, and then met up with my run club. If I was a first timer again I would better familiarize myself with a map of the stadium as to not waste my time running around the entire place looking for things. Also, use the restrooms inside the stadium to avoid the long porta potty lines, they're also very clean!\n\n\r\nRace Day: \n\nRace Start – 7:00 AM\n\nMiles 1-13: Finding My Rhythm \n\nFrom the beginning, I focused on keeping my pace controlled, aiming to stay within 12:00-13:00 per mile to conserve energy for the second half. The adrenaline of race day made it tempting to go faster, but I kept reminding myself of the bigger goal—finishing strong before 6:30.\n\nHills Strategy: Any time I hit steep inclines, I speed-walked or slow-jogged to avoid exerting too much energy. I took advantage of downhills to gain back time, letting gravity carry me while keeping my effort level steady. Miles 4-6 are the steepest of the hills, thankfully I knew what to expect as I had run a preview route of the race a few weeks prior.\n\nHydration & Nutrition: I drank from every single aid station, ensuring I stayed hydrated, I alternated between water and electrolytes at each. I had been trying to avoid a bathroom stop, but by mile 12, I knew I couldn’t hold it any longer. The lines at each restroom were so long I knew if I stopped at those I'd have a hard time getting that time back. I waited until I found restrooms with a shorter line, losing some time but ultimately feeling much better.\n\nStrava Discrepancy: Around this point, I also noticed that my Strava was measuring ahead of the official mile markers—by about a quarter mile. This was frustrating because it meant I would likely have to run farther than expected according to my watch.\n\nI reached the halfway point feeling surprisingly good, with a steady energy level. My plan was working.\n\n---\n\nMiles 13-20: The Mental & Physical Battle Begins\n\nOnce I hit mile 13, I took a moment to assess how I was feeling. Surprisingly, I still had a good amount of steady energy, though my feet were starting to ache.\n\nAt mile 17, my earbuds died. I had a backup pair waiting for me at mile 19, where my run club had a cheer zone. I was trying really hard to push myself through without music. This area is through Rodeo drive which has great scenery. Once you turn the corner though you're headed back uphill, but it's not as large of an incline as the hills in DTLA.\n\nTrying to Pick Up Pace: I attempted to speed up to 11:00-12:00 per mile, but the hills were relentless. Every time I tried to push harder, the elevation gains made it difficult. Still, I knew I wanted to make it to mile 19 with a little extra time, so I pushed through the discomfort.\n\nCheer Zone Stop (Mile 19): When I arrived, I quickly swapped out my earbuds, changed into dry socks, and freshened up with some deodorant and wipes. Unfortunately, they were out of Biofreeze, which I had really been looking forward to for my sore feet. This stop cost me about 5-6 minutes.\n\nI left the cheer zone feeling slightly refreshed but still bracing myself for what I knew would be the toughest part of the race.\n\n---\n\nMiles 20-23.1: Mental Battle\n\nThis was where things got mentally tough.\n\nThe Finish Line Tease: Around this stretch, I could see the finish line in the distance, but I still had to run past it to reach the turnaround point. Watching other runners on their way back while I still had miles to go was mentally brutal.\n\nThe Hills Were Relentless: This section of the course was almost entirely uphill. I had planned to increase my pace to 10:00-11:00 per mile, but every incline made it nearly impossible. I could feel my legs getting heavier. At this point I knew I would for sure hit my goal of sub 6:30 but because I wasn't feeling too bad and only had 6.2 miles left I changed my goal to 5:30:00 -5:40:00.\n\nIt truly seemed like the longest part of the run, waiting to hit the turnaround point. \n\nI was anticipating the wall but I never hit it, thankfully. I think that was due to me fueling properly prior to and during the race.\n\n---\n\nMiles 23.1-26.2: Pushing Through\n\nAt mile 23.1, I finally reached the turnaround point, and something inside me clicked.\n\nTunnel Vision Mode: I locked in mentally, and tuned out everything—the crowd, the pain, the time. It was just me and the road ahead.\n\nPain Disappeared: All of my pain was gone, it was probably because I took 2 ibuprofen when I stopped at mile 19. I no longer felt my sore feet or tired legs. It didn’t even feel like I had been running for over five hours. My body was just moving.\n\nCrowded Course: The biggest challenge at this point wasn’t my fatigue—it was weaving around walkers. The course had narrowed, and since I had picked up speed, I had to maneuver around large groups of people.\n\nThe Heat Factor: The sun was beating down, and there was zero shade. The heat was brutal, at every aid station I would grab 2 cups of water, one for drinking and one for pouring on myself to keep from overheating. This helped out a ton!\n\n\nThe Finish Line & Final Thoughts\n\nCrossing the finish, I was hit with a wave of emotions—relief, pride, exhaustion. I knew my training hadn’t been perfect, but I had pushed through every challenge, injury, and setback to make it to the end.\n\nI finished. And I was happy with my performance.\n\n\nPost-Race:\n\nThe moment I crossed the finish line, a wave of exhaustion, pride, and relief hit me all at once. My legs felt heavy but functional, and my body was running on pure adrenaline. I took a moment to soak it all in—I had officially completed my first marathon.\n\nGear Pickup & Finisher Photos\n\nThe first order of business was retrieving my checked gear bag. Thankfully, the process was smooth and organized, and I quickly swapped out my race shoes for a more comfortable pair of slides—my feet were aching, and the instant relief was incredible.\n\nBefore heading out, I stopped by the official finisher photo area to capture the moment. It still hadn’t fully sunk in that I had just run 26.2 miles.\n\nI still felt pretty good all things considered, I really think that was due to my pre race and negative Split strategy.\n\nBeer Garden & Post-Race Celebrations\n\nAt the engraving station, I had my medal personalized with my name and finish time. The line moved quickly, I definitely recommend waiting for it if it's something you're wanting to do.\n\nI went to the beer garden to catch up with some friends, the good thing about the race ending at the mall is that there's a ton of food options available to choose from. Also, Westfield offers special discounts to those who complete the marathon.\n\nBy this point, hunger had fully kicked in, I ordered some Din Tai Fung to go. \n\nSo far, my recovery routine has been pretty minimal:\n\nUsing my mini massage gun to loosen up my tight muscles\n\nDoing some light stretching to keep my legs from stiffening up\n\nOnce I found my car, getting out of the area wasn't too difficult. I'd say I added in about an extra 1.5 mile walk post race between the mall and finding my car.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Would I Do It Again?\n\nAbsolutely. I had so much fun running this marathon, and despite the challenges, I never once felt like I wanted to quit. If anything, I feel like I could’ve pushed myself more and increased my pace sooner—but my uphill/downhill strategy worked well, and I was able to finish strong.\n\nNow that I know what I’m capable of, I’m confident I can PR my next race. \n\n---\n\nMy advice to any beginner running the course for the first time:\n\n-Prepay for parking if you're driving yourself and know exactly where your garage is and what streets are available to get into it\n-Take the shuttle to the start from Century City, the traffic to get into Dodger Stadium was crazy, I saw people getting out and walking along the freeway.\n-Use the restrooms inside of the stadium when you get there\n-Preview run the course if you can\n-Take it slow the first 6 miles \n-Don't give into the adrenaline and other runners passing you by.\n-Fuel early and often\n-Drink from every aid station \n-They have free chili dogs at mile 6 if your stomach can handle it\n-Be mentally prepared to see the finish line on the other side when you're still at mile 19\n-If you start feeling like you're getting too hot when the sun starts to come up, pour some water on yourself, it helps a ton\n-Enjoy the race, it's really fun\n---\n\nMade with a new race report generator created by /u/herumph.",

        "Texto": "Hey guys, just wanted to share my race after what was and unforgettable pre race week and not for some fun reasons! Let me explain.\n\nRace Information\n\n* **Name:** Media Maraton Villa Carlos Paz * **Date:** MARCH 16, 2025 * **Distance:** Half Marathon * **Location:** Cordoba - Argentina. *** Shoe for the race: New Balance SC Elite V4 (first race using carbon plated shoes)\n\nAbout me: started running in 2021, at 41 YO, now I am 45 YO, running 4 times a week and going to the gym the other three days.\n\nGoals\n\nI was aiming at around 1:46:00 time, with a pace around 5:00 per KM.\n\nTraining\n\nSubscribed to Runna for this one. Been hearing  a lot of good things about the app, and since, because of my schedule, I train alone and very early in the morning (I run 4 times a week and 3 days I lift at the gym), the app helped my with structuring my plan, between easy runs and speed sessions and it pushed me hard! It was a challenge for sure, but it was a lot of fun and made me feel stronger than ever as training progressed. It was a 12 week training plan.\n\nThe Unexpected\n\nAs I've said, training was going awesome and the hype for the race was at peak level. This is a race that I wasn't able to run last year because I was dealing with peroneal problems that had me off running for almost 6 months.\n\nThing is, ten days before the race, while at the gym, I decided to not to a hard leg session that day because I wanted to start deloading the legs to be well rested for the race. Stupidly I decided to make 3 series of jump box excercise. At the last rep of the last series, I stumbled while jumping, and bang my tibia with the box HARD! It instantly swelled and blood was coming out! I thought it was the bang, so I went home and put ice on it. The thing is the bang left a scar (it was a hard hit) and that scar, once it healed, would stop more blood from coming out of the injury, so two days before, the area was incredibly swollen and it made a hematoma. I have a friend who is a doctor, and he gave me a corticosteroid injection to see if it would get better but nothing, so the decision was made to make a cut into the wound to take the coagulated blood out of there. That was last tuesday, so 5 days before the race. When I got out, and for the next three days I was having a hard time even trying to walk, so I saw myself almost 100% out of the race. I was borderline depressed after all the training I went trough.\n\nSince the race is around 50 km away from where I live, we reserved to have a four day holiday with the family, so we had to go anyway. You can imagine my mood. Having to come and having planned the holiday around the race. But the foot started to get better on saturday, I mean, the wound was giving me a lot of pain since it hasn't healed properly yet, but i was able to walk with little pain, so I asked my friend if I could run. He said to me to try runnning 3 o 4 km the day before and see how it responded. The fear was that I get a hematoma again. Went ofr it and had no pain while running.\n\nThe day of the race was key to see how I woke uo, and if there was no blood or the area was swollen I had a green light. Woke up that day and, MIRACULOUSLY it was ok. The happiness I had was hard to explain. I was able to at least try to run the race, which two days before it was impossible for me to even think of being able to run.\n\nPre-race\n\nWoke up at 5:00. Cured the wound, and prepared for the race. Breakfast was at 5:30, and i had a coffee with two toast with some butter on them. Drank half a Gatorade before leaving and had a nougat 20 minutes before the start.\n\nRace\n\nIn training, the targeted pace was 5:00 per km (8 minutes and 3 per mile), but since I wasn't able to run  at all last week, and taking into account that i had no idea how my leg was going to respond at the race, the fact that I was there at the start just made me soooo happy!\n\nWeather was great, it wasn't cold but neither hot. Started the race and gradually tried to get the pace that I've trained for, and was feeling great! No pain whatsoever. So i was able to mantain it and even get a little faster on the second half. Course had some hills on it, so it's not an easy route, but I was feeling great and couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I was to even be there running. Last meters I had a terrible cramp on my left leg, but I endured and finished strong with a time of 1:43:31 according to my watch. Official time could be a little less.\n\nNutrition wise I had two caffeinated gels, one 6 km in, and the other 12 km in, I had a third one ready but decided to skip and instead ate a banana that was given to me at around 15k.\n\nRunning is a privilege, and I always feel that way, but never more clear after the incredible journey leading up to this race!\n\nPost-race\n\nFamily was waiting at the finish line (wife and two kids, 8 and 4), and I saw them twice during the course, so it was very emotional. I cried like a baby once I crossed the finish line and even more when I saw them after finishing.\n\nSo this was and unbelievable race for me, taught me a lesson to be even more grateful to being able to do this at this age, and the privilege I have of being healthy. And also, so proud of me that even with all the setbacks of the injury, I never in my mind gave up, and was able to endure it all and be there at the start.\n\nThank you for reading, this ended up being a long race report and sorry for the grammar, I am from Argentina so english is not my first language!\n\nKEEP RUNNING!!!!!\n"

        "Texto": "The running community here is one of the better ones. Good information and very little bs. But the majority of questions that get asked are “what should I? “ questions. What shoes, what gels, what socks, what pace etc. While it’s great to get ideas from here, you’ve got to try it. One of the coolest things about running is there’s a million ways to do it. We’ve got short distance runners, marathoners, ultra runners. Vegans to junk food addicts. Plated shoes to barefoot runners. Zone 2 only vs every run is a workout. The list is endless, but the best part is there is no right or wrong answer. Every single person is unique in how they do it. Just because it’s good / bad for someone doesn’t mean the product or practice is good / bad, it just means it does or doesn’t work for them. A great example is I absolutely despise the ASICS Novablast shoe, it does not work for my feet & strike. Does that make it a bad shoe? Of course not. It’s one of the most popular training shoes on earth. But for me, it’s a no. So if you’re kinda new to it all just keep that in mind. Just because someone else loves / hates it does not mean it will / won’t work for you. It’s an expensive trial and error process, but ya gotta just keep trying stuff. Just something I had been thinking about. Dont rule something out just because the masses don’t like it. And dont think something has to be the answer just because everyone seems to like it. ",

I used the Garmin plan and found the rigidity of it unhelpful for me. But I worked out when was best for me to take gels and felt increasingly confident as training went on that I'd be able to do it. The watch told me that 2:15 was possible, so I took that as my goal. By the last few of weeks, I was not getting out on runs as often as I should. I failed my last long run before the race because I was ill prepared and the temperature was hotter than it had been for all previous runs. This was a small cause for concern because race day was even warmer. From a non running perspective, I had been doing pilates which I think has made me even a little bit stronger. This probably was good injury prevention.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe day before I arrived in Cambridge by train and set out to watch an ice hockey game. Good things to keep my mind off pre race jitters. When I got to my friend's house, I was so nervous I could barely stomach three slices of pizza. I did wear my doc martens which wasn't a fab shoe choice. On race day my left foot hurt and my calf was a bit tight. Breakfast was a cup of tea, soreen and peanut butter. I hired an ebike and cycled in which actually helped massively with the jitters. When I got there, I stretched out and warmed up my joints and muscles. Pilates paid off! It felt good to have an actual warm up routine instead of skipping it or idly copying others. After umming and ahhing, I ultimately wore my long leggings instead of shorts. I have a note on Strava reminding me that 16 degrees is shorts temperature. Today was highs of 18. But I reasoned that it wouldn't reach 16 degrees until midday, and I hoped to be done by then. I'm glad I did because my leggings have two pockets that I could put my phone and gels in. The shorts have a measly tum pocket. It was worth the extra heat I think. I wore the darn tough running socks which may have protected my feet, but I guess I wouldn't know without doing the same in my standard underarour socks? When I say gels, what I mean is Harley's Jelly (jello) in Strawberry flavour, made up with twice as much more water than called for.\n\n# Race \n\nThe atmosphere at the Cambridge Half is beautiful. So many people line the streets to cheer you on. Lots of them call out your name from on your race number.\n\nI started too quick because of the thrill and the pace of those around me. I don't actually mind this because I felt strong and I don't think I'd have been able to finish fast even with a steadier start.\n\nThe first mile was a bit squished. You share Elizabeth way bridge with cars and pedestrians so there's not much room for runners. Being forced to slow down a bit was probably a good thing for me.\n\nMile two you double back on yourself so I spotted the pacer that I was aimed for a way ahead which was a bit disheartening. I'm not so good at maths so at this point I didn't realise I had nothing to worry about.\n\nI ran past one of the places I used to live and I didn't realise how much a boost nostalgia would be!\n\nAt the three mile point you hit the colleges a d it is stunning! There's bands and choirs and students cheering you on. And the buildings are breath taking, almost to distraction!\n\nMy friends cheered me on at mile five. The fact that I knew they were there gave me something to look forward to. I knew them cheering would be a boost. But the anticipation of it was too! And they placed themselves well, knowing that the next battle was Grantchester. Grantchester is lovely to walk through and was, for a brief moment, beautiful enough to spur me on. But you don't have the variation of the colleges and there's fewer people to cheer. Those that have cycled out, however, are fabulous. The encouragement is less densely packed, but it is just as heartfelt.\n\nParts of these three miles were the type of low gradient steady incline that absolutely kills me off. Having trained on proper hills was not enough to make that less true! Between the mile 7 and 8 markers, I truly wanted to go home and never run again. Cambridge is very good for flat expanses of featureless fields. This isn't motivating for running. But then you hit the water stand and then the villages and more level ground and everything is sunshine and glorious again.\n\nMy watch talks to me in km, and it was weirdly helpful to think in km even for a race measured in miles. I got to 8km before the finish line and began a count down. \"In just 3km, I'll have 5km left to go. That's a parkrun. I can do a parkrun.\" Low and behold, at the 5k to go mark there was a woman calling out \"5k to go. That's a parkrun. You can do a parkrun\" and she gave me so much life. By this point, you're approaching streets you've seen before. The course is kind not to take you on too many more inclines and absolutely no more bridges. I ran past Steak and Honour, the spot I'd designated as my post-run burger. You start to get big crowds again all cheer you on. And, completely unexpectedly, my friends had stayed were they were instead of heading home like they said! I was flagging hard at this point, but there they were screaming my name from mile 11. They'd not realised that their spot was both mile 5 and 11 so they stuck around! (They told me after that they had realised they'd not seen the 2h15 pacer and knew I was going to do it!)\n\nIn the last 3k, a lot more encouragement was being passed about between runners. We were there. We could do it. My mantra was run strong, and at this moment that meant strong breathing. If I wasn't focused, breathing became strained and my airways felt restricted. Strong was breathing.\n\nOf course, that couldn't stop me sprinting (well, as close as I can do to sprinting) the last few hundred metres across the line.\n\n# Post-race\n\nYou finish up back at midsummer common where the music is pumping loud and theirs a man on the microphone hyping people up (and he stuck around with the same level of support and enthusiasm for every last runner!) Sprinting was worth it, though it did mean after I finished I hyperventilated a bit. I flagged down one of the wonderful stewards who stood with me and helped me regulate my breathing again and gave me a big hug before sending me on my way.\n\nPicked up my alcohol free beer, my tote and my medal! They were out of water! Which was a disaster but I coped.\n\nThe youths/children on bag check were lovely. In fact, the children supporting the stewarding team (and those spectating with their parents) were a massive highlight of the whole race. High fives and boost buttons galore!\n\nAnd in my bag, as well as water, I had very sensibly stashed a thermos of tea. Oh my goodness. They say nothing new on race day and I have had tea after almost all of my training runs. So having a cup of tea to run to might actually have had an impact. By this point, runners high had kicked in massively. And a general sense of pride that I'd done it AND I'd smashed my target. I was walking through town thinking about booking in a full marathon after summer and what my next half goals were. So much for quitting never to run again at mile 7!\n\nI was back at Steak and Honour, this time spectating and cheering as I went. I picked up my cheese burger and sat at Christ's Pieces to eat it. I did my stretching routine, thank you again pilates. I jogged (jogged!! Mind you a good hour after the race now) to an ebike and cycled home. Later were going to the spa for a much needed hot tub.\n\nSmashed my time goal. No injuries but for a massive blister on my right foot. Had so much fun!\n\nMade with a new race report generator created by u/herumph\n\n(Edited for formatting and some ridiculous spelling errors!)",

        "Texto": "Spent the last hour of my long run trying the new Pumas out. They're pretty sweet. For those interested, here's a recap.\n\nQuick and Dirty:\n\n**Upper:** Comfortable and breathable. Everything you need, nothing you don’t. Toe cap won’t provide much protection. For some reason, Puma couldn’t be bothered to add a loop on the tongue to put the laces through (although pics from their website do show loops, my pair sadly has none). By the end of the run the tongue had slid down below the top of the laces, which had been biting into my foot. However, there are plenty of ventilation holes on the tongue that I wound up lacing through which should work fine. Excellent lock-down.\n\n**Midsole:** Amazing. 10/10. Soft, almost plush for a trail shoe. Despite the softness the foam is quite responsive. The carbon plate definitely gives it some pop. Feels like a very comfortable shoe for long races.\n\n**Sole:** Just enough tread for light trails. Given the shoe isn’t designed for technical terrain, the lugs are perfect. The 3mm lugs feel similar to the Agravic Speed Ultra.\n\n**Fit:** True to size. Narrow and low volume. Might be too snug for wide feet, but hard for me to say as I have some narrow and low volume feet.\n\n**Value:** TBD but I’m loving the shoe so far. $230 is a competitive price for a trail super shoe.\n\nIs this the trail super shoe we have been asking for? After walking around the neighborhood and running in them once, I am cautiously optimistic that the answer is YES. The cushion is incredibly soft yet has a bounciness to it that turns into screaming speed when the pace picks up. This truly feels like a road super shoe that has a little tread and a little more stability. Actually, a decent amount of stability compared to a road super shoe. However, I would not want to run on technical or rocky terrain in them. But rip some flowy single track and fire roads? Yes, please. These are the ticket.\n\nThe closest comparison IMO is the Adidas Agravic Speed Ultra. I’m reserving total judgment until more miles have been ripped, but my first impression is that the *Pumas absolutely dunk on the ASUs* in every way. They are much more stable, yet just as fast (and maybe even faster). The foam is also way softer, yielding greater comfort over longer distances. Heel lock-down? Set it and forget it. Breathability is on par with the ASU, if not better. I could actually feel the gentle ocean breeze on my feet as I ripped the fire roads of the Marin Headlands.\n\nNeedless to say, I’m looking forward to many more miles in these bad kitties.",

The last time I bought some - Saucony Phoenix 7, a good few years ago now - I also picked up some \"corrective\" insoles I bought after gait analysis. IIRC, I overpronate slightly (and have to be very, VERY careful with my right knee, as it's a little injured) and the insoles correct that.I have not run much since, because of said knee, but now am in a position to start again from scratch. W1d1 of C25k kind of scratch.\n\nSpeaking to a colleague yesterday who literally travels all over the world to run marathons, she told me that she doesn't know of anybody who wears corrective insoles and has never tried them herself. She uses shoes with a fairly low stack and said that working on correct form was likely to be more beneficial than having an insole. She recommended trying them without vs trying them with and see how my knee is.\n\nIt made me think, though. How many of you use corrective insoles? Are they a permanent solution? What advice would you give me about how to proceed?\n\nAny help appreciated. Thanks.\n\nEDIT - Thanks for all the responses! A really interesting mix of pros and cons, from people who love them to people who don't. I'm going to make a podiatry appointment first and foremost and take it from there. I appreciate you all!",

I was never a runner growing up and started in 2020. Ran 4:42 marathon in 2023 in Philly and 1:53ish at the Cambridge side Half in 2024.\n\nTraining\n\nTraining for this race went pretty solid. I averaged \\~31 miles per week over 10 total weeks of training and peaked at 36 miles. This included one long run and one structured workout a week. During this time I time-trialed a 10K at 48:16 and I hit 2x3mi a 7:55/mile average in a workout pretty easily. That 10k time predicts to a 1:47 with the vdot calculator so I thought 1:48 would be a safe goal.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI woke up at 6am and started drinking coffee to get things moving (it was a very successful morning). Then around 7am, I had a bagel with peanut butter and a scoop of skratch. I was kind of hungry still before leaving, so I had 2 Hawaiian rolls before heading out the door. During the race I fueled with never second C30 gels, having one 15 minutes before and then one every 30 minutes during the race. I also carried a handheld with skratch in it, so I totaled about 70 grams of carbs per hour.\n\nFor race kit, it was projected to be low/mid 20 degrees F, so I opted for full length fleece tights, quarter zip, light knit hat and light gloves. For shoes I went with the adidas adios pro 3 that had about 120 miles on them and a few races already.\n\nIt was about a 20 minute drive to the start for us and we arrived around 8:45 for a 10am start. Parking was very straight forward and there were a few spots left in the cape cod melody tent parking lot at this time, but we opted to just park at the charter school next door because it was easier and maybe 2 minute further of a walk to the conference center where the bib pickup was. For some reason, a bunch of people were trying to park at the hotel/conference center by the start (despite emails being clear this was for hotel guests only) but there was a long line of cars getting in and getting out after the race seemed difficult from this lot.\n\nOnce we made it inside the conference center, it only took a minute to grab our race bibs and we had almost an hour to kill before the race. Luckily there are tables setup for people to sit at and you're able to remain inside the expo area before the race. We brought throwaway clothes, but didn't need them since we headed to the start at 9:50 and were staying warm in the expo center.\n\nI didn't end up needing a bathroom before the race, but there were a few bathrooms inside the expo center and porta potties by the start. Lines for both seemed quite long, maybe 20-30 minutes.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race forecast was accurate and it was mid-low 20's F at the start with decent wind gusts and moderate sustained winds, however with the sun. The wind ended up being a significant factor at some points, but because there were so many turns there were some moments of relief.\n\nAfter the gun went off, chaos ensued. The marathon, relays, half and 10k all start at the same time and there are no pace groups or guidelines for where to line up. Because of this, everyone was trying to run different paces right off the bat. I tried to run by feel for the first few miles and clocked in slightly faster than goal pace for the first 3 miles.\n\nI feel like I finally settled in around mile 4 and I still felt decent, however I could tell the rolling hills were taking a toll on my legs. The course was pretty much gentle rolling hills the entire way, which training on the Charles river did not prepare me for. By mile 7 my pace started to slip because my legs felt more and more drained with each hill and the downhills were never quite long enough for me to recover. I clocked in about 420 feet of elevation gain for the half, which is not a ton, but it was more than I was prepared for.\n\nBasically, my pace kept dropping with each mile and I was fighting to keep going. I kept telling myself not to quit and was fighting the urge to walk from mile 7 onwards. I kept trying to focus on the mile I was in, but knowing how much of the race was left made me anxious and my negative thoughts were really snowballing. Every mile felt like a marathon in its own and each uphill or wind gust felt like it might be my last.\n\nI did my best to hold on and managed somewhat of a kick for the last 0.1 and clocked in at 1:50:47.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI completely missed where they were handing out medals and found the nearest curb to slump down to. After a few minutes of sitting and some water I found my girlfriend who finished shortly after me and we went inside to get warm. The local girlscout troop was there and I bought 2 boxes of cookies which we broke into immediately. We sat for maybe 20 minutes dazed and confused and when we found out the award ceremony was cancelled we headed home. I immediately pounded electrolytes, coffee and a protein shake before showering. Once we had gathered ourselves, we headed out to Sam Diegos for some colossal margaritas and queso.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the PB and I gave everything I felt I had on the day. I am slightly disappointed though to miss the sub 1:50 goal. I can't help but think with a flat course and better weather I could've had it. Up next is the cape cod marathon in October, where I'll be going for 3:50!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

We don't talk about that one.\n\nSecond marathon, 2022: Committed to [Hal Higdon's Novice 2 training plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/)...sort of. I simply covered the prescribed distance without any regard for pacing or effort. If memory serves, I ran Z3-4 every run and peaked at 35 mpw. It was enough to survive the race in 5:27:03.\n\nThird marathon, 2023: Committed to [Hal Higdon's Dopey training plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/dopey-challenge/). Again, with no regard for pacing or effort, I slogged through an entire training season with mostly Zone 3-4 running. However, a higher weekly mileage compared to last year (42 mpw at peak) helped me break 5 hours with a time of 4:37:40. Notably, this was the first race that didn't feel like an awful slog the entire way. I was shocked at how energetic and alive I felt at mile 12, to the point where I was genuinely brought to tears (I would soon hit a wall at mile 17ish, and jog to the finish, but I digress). That mid-race moment stuck with me, and gave me a peek at what magical can happen when you put in the work.\n\nAround the end of 2023, I came across this subreddit while running started having its moment on social media. This was my first exposure to 80/20 training (*Wait, I should run slowly most of the time? I have to run fast? I have to sprint????*) I settled on [Hal's Intermediate 2 half marathon training plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/intermediate-2-half-marathon/) and committed to his prescribed paces, though far from perfect. I had no idea what my 5k base was, so I ran full-send 400m sessions. I also struggled to find threshold pace, and it wouldn't be until the end of the 12-week training cycle that I sorta got the hang of it. My effort, although imperfect, paid off. On January 24, 2024, I met my reach goal of a sub-2 hour half marathon for the first time in my life. I remember choking back sobs at mile 11 when I knew a sub-2 was in the bag.\n\nThen came 2024, the magic year. By this time, I had been running for almost a decade, with 12 half-marathons and 3 full marathons under my belt. However, 2024 is what I consider to be the start of my true running journey, marked by a year of running \"firsts\":\n\n* First sub-2 half\n* First negative-split race\n* **First consistent base-build** prior to starting a marathon block (I repeated [Hal's advanced 5k program](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/5k-training/advanced-5k/) 5 times, with deload weeks sprinkled inbetween, along with my usual lifting regimen)\n* First run club (and first RC pet peeve - when the group lead runs faster than stated pace!)\n* First sub-25 5k (I teared up at mile 2 seeing a \"7:5x\" average pace for the first time in my racing career)\n\nSome sillier \"firsts\"....\n\n* Running fueled (I know, I know)\n* Racing fueled (I KNOW....)\n* First gels\n* First running vest\n* First carbon plated shoes (s/o Saucony)\n* First Strava post\n\nAnd last but not least, my first time tackling Pftiz 18/55.\n\n# Training\n\nIn August 2024, I embarked on my first PFitz 18/55 with a humble 5 mile run with 2 @ HMP. I pored over his Advanced Marathoning book excited and nervous at the journey ahead. I'm not sure what scared me more: peaking at 55mpw, his double-digit mile workouts at race pace, or his 1600m @ 5k repeats toward the end of the training block. No, wait...it was definitely the **THREE** 20-mile long runs he prescribed, having only done one per past training block.\n\nWhile I stared at the mountain of miles ahead of me, one mantra helped me keep my head up and keep going: ***Run slow, to run fast, to run far.***\n\nI went by the book - running in his prescribed zones, getting adequate nutrition/sleep, strength training 3x/week, and supplementing my training with regular visits to my PT. I was able to hit workouts/mileage and still recover, taking easy days easy, and going hard in the paint when called.\n\nFor the most part, I hit the plan as written, with a slight pullback in mileage when I sustained pain in my left hip toward the end of the training block. After PT, dry-needling, and rest, I was able to work back to the prescribed mileage in the 2 weeks leading up to race day. I completed this training block 89% to plan (765.79 out of 862.2 miles).\n\n*Weekly mileage progression*\n\n13, 34, 16, 40, 43, 45, 37, 50, 54, 48, 42, 56, 46, 32\\*, 42\\*, 53, 23\\*, 45, 46 (Race Week)  \n\\*did not meet prescribed weekly mileage due to injury\n\n*Notable runs (T-xx weeks until race day)*\n\n* T-16: Interrupted by insane flash tropical storm.

I wasn't really familiar with your game.\" So springy!\n* T-11: Long run (18 w/ strides), relaxed the whole time. Gave me confidence that I could put out a solid negative split on race day.\n* T-9: Started practicing race day fueling at 1 gel per 4 miles (I realized that choking down gummy bears wasn't cutting it for me anymore).\n* T-1: V8 w/ 3 x 1600 @ 5K pace, 5ks felt strong thanks to 'Defying Gravity' from the Wicked movie.

Wanted to quit multiple times.\n* T-13: MP 16 w/ 10 @ MP. could not do anything except trudge through with a million long breaks. body wanted to be asleep the ENTIRE time. mentally very rough.\n* T-4: V8 w/ 5 x 600 @ 5K pace. horrendous run. hip & toe pain, leg muscles tense.\n\nSurprisingly, what did not make either list? The aforementioned 20 mile runs. All 3 sessions were lovely and relaxing.\n\n*Conclusions from Training Plan*\n\nAs a PFitz first-timer, I was intimidated that I wouldn't be able to hit the workouts as prescribed, but found the weekly progressions very manageable. I took sleep very seriously and took full rest days (no cross-training). The plan wasn't too difficult to rearrange as needed to allow enough recovery for LR/tough workouts.\n\nI can confidently say that overall my fitness has steadily improved as both recovery and workout paces are lower at the same effort. While I realize these are \"beginner gains,\" I won't discount my decade+ of running prior to this training block. My past training plans, although bare-minimum in mileage, taught me consistency, discipline, and getting used to long runs. PFitz gave me an opportunity to conquer tough speed sessions, enjoy restful long rungs, strengthen my mind-muscle connection, and run the strongest and most magical marathon of my life.\n\n# THE RACE\n\nI’ve run the Disney Marathon twice before, so I was very familiar with the [course](https://www.magicofrunning.com/wdw-marathon-weekend-overview-maps/) and pre-race logistics. The course loops through all 4 Disney parks, but it is mostly long slogs of unsupported highway and a torturous parking lot loop at Mile 22ish. There are character photo-ops along the way, but I did not stop for any of them. I did, however, fist pump enthusiastically with the live music performers/DJs along the way.\n\n*Fueling*\n\n6 Huma gels (1 every \\~4 miles). I wound up taking one right before the water station closest to each 4 mile increment. I alternated between their Mango and Strawberry regular gels and caffeine and “extra electrolyte\" gels.\n\n**Race Day**\n\nMy friends and I had been in town for 4 days partaking in the Dopey Challenge, so by the time marathon day rolled around, we had all gotten used to the 2:30am wake-up calls.\n\nAfter a lovely full nights sleep (also a first!), I was up at 2:30 to start getting ready and get my gear on. Race start was going to be comfortable at mid 40s, dropping to low 40s, then going back up to mid 50s by mile 20. I opted for shorts, longsleeve shirt + vest, and headband. I also used my boyfriend's old socks as makeshift mittens :)\n\nAte a small bowl of rice chex with lactaid, 1/2 banana, and a bottle of grapefruit LMNT and successfully pooped(!). Was out the door by 3:05 wrapped in a makeshift mylar skirt and poncho tied around me.\n\n*Start Line and out to the Highway (9:38 | 9:08 | 9:06)* I realize shortly before start that I accidentally tossed one of my makeshift mitten-socks aside with my mylar. Whoops. My corral approaches start, fireworks, and we're off. First 1/2 mile is chill. I don't waste any energy trying to dodge and weave through the crowd. As I settle into my own race, I mentally commit to \"finding magic in every mile,\" like a cool costume, funny sign, or a fellow runner.\n\n*Highway (9:07 | 9:01 | 9:18 | 9:31 |9:04)* I'm peeved at the aggressive camber of Orlando highways, so I run downhill in a sortof wide zig zag motion. But overall, I feel prepared and steady. I'm grateful for the ankle mobility work I did to address a slight niggle during training. At mile 5, I make a gametime decision to stop by a portapotty with no lines. In hindsight, I'm glad I did.\n\n\\*Magic Kingdom (\\*9:25 | 9:29) IYKYK. Ive done this race 3x so I didn't think I'd cry this time. However, The Mouse(TM) manages to get me yet again, as I find myself choking back sobs running down Main St. with the cheering crowd and beautiful lights all around. I stop to take a picture in front of the castle (it would be my only photo stop of the race). A little fatigue sets in at the back of MK (probably coming down from the high of Main St), but I resolve to continue finding magic in each mile.\n\n*Highway* (9:09 | 9:12 | 9:04 |9:10 | 9:00 | 8:41\\*)\\* Pace still feels manageable. I feel strong and steady on the uphills. The Star Wars mile is cool, but I silently wonder about the smoke affecting people with asthma. I glance down at my watch at 13.1 and see 2:0xx. I'm content with not breaking my C-goal of sub 4, but quickly tell myself: *don't count yourself out yet*. *You have more in you.* I tell myself to leave the past 13 miles behind, and to get to mile 20 by mentally \"starting\" an 8 mile run with 100m strides - a workout I was very familiar with. The strides at every mile keep me in good form. Runner math kept me energetic: *this is just 8 miles on top of the 1,000 you already ran last year!* The thought of *1,000 miles conquered* strikes me. I feel a sudden, positive shift in my pace and energy.\n\nBy the time mile 20 rolls around, I realize sub 4 is within reach.\n\n\\*Animal Kingdom & Parking Lot (\\*8:55 | 8:52 | 8:37 | 8:52 | 8:29 | 8:31) After mile 20, the race is a blur. I brace for \"the wall\" that never came. I tell myself to keep my head up, stay steady, and try to gain speed. Counting down the miles, I set out to make mile 25 \"my\" mile. A victory mile. I promised myself I would enjoy & soak in every moment of it, no matter how I felt.\n\n*Hollywood Studios & Boardwalk (8:32 | 8:43 | 8:44)* I'm still feeling pretty strong, and quietly encourage my fellow racers who look like they're fighting demons (been there). *Boooo* to the DJ at mile 24ish who kept saying \"welcome to the worst part of the race! no one likes it here!\" Seriously? Luckily there are a few amazing spectators on the boardwalk. I look forward to this section every year. A kind man tells me I’m looking strong and making good pace. I say thank you so much. He then responds, \"I'm proud of you.\" I cry. I start to finally feel fatigued at mile 25 but keep going. *My victory mile!*\n\n*Finish Line* I don't have the words to describe the feeling of turning the corner to the finish line, except these two: GOSPEL CHOIR. In the final 100m, I do some light crowdwork. I cross the finish line in quiet disbelief.\n\n**Final Time 3:57:54 (1st half – 2:02:16, 2nd half – 1:55:48)**\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI grab my $600 banana, medals, and fake cheese. I beeline to my resort bus, hobble to the room, shower, and go back to the spectator area to cheer on my friend who would soon finish his first marathon!\n\nThat afternoon, I choke down some eggs and the rest of my spaghetti from the night before. We laze around until dinnertime at Morimoto's for a victory peking duck. I feel surprisingly great, and only slightly sore.\n\n**Take-Aways**\n\nWhen I reflect on this training cycle, two things stick out:\n\n1. I looked forward to most of my runs, which made it easy to get out the door most days. I attribute this to the 80/20 split, gave me \"permission\" to enjoy chill and relaxing runs, while also providing enough physical rest to crush the hard sessions.\n2. The hard workouts built my confidence and helped me build mental grit that paid dividends on race day -- negative split, zero bonking, minimal post-race soreness, enjoying it all from start to finish. I couldn't have asked for a better outcome.\n\nI agree with how a fellow r/running member described training: it's not what everyone assumes it will be. 10% is about staying motivated to get out the door and hit all your workouts. The other 90% is injury management, load management, and all the stress and learning that comes with it. That 90% made training dynamic and fun.\n\n**What’s Next?**\n\nTaking it easy with the prescribed Pfitz 5wk recovery plan. I’ve got my first 15k (8 weeks after the marathon) and I’m banking on the marathon fitness to carry me through that. After that, it’s several weeks of 5k plans to build a strong and speedy base.\n\nI want to spend 2025 working on increasing my cadence and breaking 24:00 in the 5k.\n\nFor the first time in my life, it seems like a BQ may be in reach within in my lifetime. But for now, I'll likely commit to another marathon next January. See you then, r/running :)"

TL;DR is at the bottom.\n\n\nI logged all my runs in total run distance and time (including warm ups and cool downs), and converted them to equivalent VDOTs. I understand that’s not the intended usage of VDOTs, but it gives me a way to normalize all the runs of various lengths to give me a sense of my training progress. You can see how the three training blocks have different improvement trends in the graph [here](https://imgur.com/a/rHNlfrc).\n\n\n### Background\n\nMid-30s male (5’5” 120 lbs) with casual sports experience in high school. No track training, just played squash recreationally which gave some endurance I guess. Running speed was above average based on the various sports class tests. Since college, most of my exercise came in the form of bike commuting ~1 hour/day for several days a week. But this stopped after several years since I moved too far away to bike safely. Didn’t really have much exercise for 5+ years until I picked up running in 2023.\n\n\n### Training\n\nI started weight lifting with a personal trainer in early 2023 and thought I’d run on the treadmill to get more value out of the gym. Living in Texas the summer heat is brutal so I just ran exclusively on the treadmill almost all of 2023. At that time, I ran without a plan, training about every other day while slowly adding distance and speed. Eventually, I contemplated signing up for the Austin Marathon in 2024 once I managed to run 13 miles. Unfortunately, perhaps because of running exclusively on the treadmill or the haphazard ramp up in mileage/pace, I started getting IT band syndrome on my right knee in September 2023. The pain was bad enough that I could only run 3 miles or so before a sharp pain shot up my knee and I had to stop. I tried many things to improve the ITBS, from trying many different stability shoes to incorporating dynamic warmup / stretching cooldown routines. By the time my knee pain finally became more manageable it was clearly too late to attempt a marathon. So I signed up for the Half Marathon, loosely followed the Runner’s World plan and completed the race in about 2:13:00. After that I was determined to run a marathon and approach the training with more structure.\n\nMarathon 1 - June 2024\nI decided on the Pfitz 18/55 training plan after reading all the glowing recommendations on Reddit. Since I had never run further than HM distance, I arbitrarily set my goal time to be sub-4. I also started keeping a run journal and logged every run I did to keep track of any niggles in case my ITBS flares up again. As the weather got nicer I mixed in some outdoor runs as I thought the treadmill was contributing to some of the injuries. My body did not appreciate the ramp up in weekly mileage together with hard workouts, I was always tired with restless legs at night together with minor knee/foot pains popping up. Nonetheless, I completed all but 3 prescribed runs. At the end of the plan, I happened to be vacationing in Australia, so I started looking for a race there. Funnily enough, nobody thought to organize a marathon in June when the weather is perfect for running. So I just ended up doing a self-guided marathon and finished 3:59:15. I felt really strong and ready to run the next day, but sadly got quite sick and was out of commission for close to 2 weeks immediately following the marathon.\n\n\nMarathon 2 and 3 - Austin Marathon\nI officially caught the running bug and set my sights on the Austin Marathon as soon as I returned to Texas in July. There was still plenty of time, so I decided to do two marathon blocks back-to-back - Hansons Advanced Marathon and Pfitz 18/70. I thought this would help me transition to higher weekly mileage. I truncated the first couple weeks, and added some odd miles to the Hansons plan since I was already accustomed to 50+ miles. For this whole plan I ran everything outdoors despite the Texas summer, with temperatures over 80F for most of the runs. I had two bonked long runs that made me rethink my fueling strategy (and my sanity running in >95F heat). Overall, I thought the Hansons plan worked really well for me because of the simple structure, shorter runs (especially during the summer) and plenty of lactate threshold sessions. You can see the steady equivalent VDOT improvement over this block. This block ended in November with a HM race in which I finished ~1:36:00 (70F and 90% RH).\n\nI immediately jumped into week 4 of the Pfitz 18/70 plan to prepare for the Austin Marathon. Somewhere in between training and fun runs I had PBs in 5k, 10k and 15k of 50 equivalent VDOT, this gave me the confidence to aim for a 3:10:00 marathon goal. I was able to hit almost all the runs except for the long runs with parts at race pace - I came up short each time. I also decided to run a marathon (!!!) while on vacation 4 weeks before the Austin one. I treated it like an extended long run and finished in ~3:25:00 (46 VDOT). During this trip I probably overtrained on hill sprints and sustained more serious calves soreness that took over 2 weeks to completely heal up. Overall I didn’t think this training plan worked well for me compared to the Hansons plan. My improvement was not as noticeable, perhaps a sign that my newbie gain is finally coming to an end. This led to me second guessing my goal time, as I thought to adjust to 3:15:00. On the other hand, the 3:15:00 pacer whom I met at the 20 mile long run gave me some encouraging comments that made me continue to consider the 3:10:00 goal.\n\n### Pre-race\n\nI did the standard 3-day 500g carb load. I baked a large pan of mochi cake (800g total carbs) and took a bite every hour until I could not stomach anymore. In between I supplemented with sugary drinks and curry rice.\n\nOn race morning, I woke up at 2 AM and couldn’t fall back asleep. So I drank about 50g of carbs to stay full. Breakfast at 5 AM was the usual oatmeal plus americano that I eat every single day.\n\n### Race\n\nStarting temperature was around 39F, perfect temperature for a marathon but colder than I am used to. It was also quite windy at 15 MPH and some gusts. I wore my usual tank top, shorts and gloves, but also added arm sleeves that I bought at the last minute and stuffed the gloves with Hothands hand warmers. My hands get cold easily so I was really worried about them being too stiff to get gels out of my waist pocket. My usual race shoes are Saucony Endorphin Pro 4, but the Endorphin Elite just went on sale and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to try them. So I raced in the Elites after only running in them for a 7 mile VO2max run, which in retrospect felt like a gamble that paid off. I met up with the 3:15:00 pacer at the start to have a few words as my strategy was to drop back and eventually catch up near the halfway point, then if I felt strong I would continue on to catch the 3:10:00 pacer near the end. My fueling plan was Gu gels every 4 miles, with 3 caffeine free packs first then 3 caffeine packs at the end. I also brought my own 14 oz bottle filled with two sticks of Liquid IV, mainly to balance my waist pack and to take some electrolytes in case I needed it.\n\nMiles 1-6\n\nThe first 3 miles were uphill along Congress, which fortunately was tailwind, so this part felt quite effortless. In fact it felt so easy that I didn’t even realize I was at the top of the hill until near the turn towards the downhill portion along 1st Street. At this point I checked my watch and realized I was about 20 seconds ahead of schedule. Even though the next 3 miles were headwind, the descent made it easy to absorb the gusts. I did feel some of the winds were pushing me a bit, so I tried to find some tall folks to draft off of (the joys of being a shorter runner :)). At around the 5th mile my running friend, who I was expecting to meet at the start line, caught up to me. We exchanged a couple words and he pushed on as he was racing the half marathon and I still had a long way to go. I am not a good downhill runner, and I could feel my legs did not enjoy the long descent, so I tried to be cautious about my pace here. Well, that wasn’t terribly successful with the race atmosphere and I ended up gaining yet another 30-ish seconds from this segment.\n\nMiles 7-12\n\nAs we turned west onto the rolling hills part of the course, I saw my wife at the corner for the first time. The last time I ran the half we missed each other in the crowd so I made sure to catch her this go. As the road straightened up I saw a banner not far ahead… I wasn’t supposed to catch the 3:15:00 group for another 6 miles! I thought to myself that this is going to be a long day and I’m going to pay for the price of being too aggressive so early. The damage is already done so I just decided to tuck in to the group and get some wind protection instead. I basically ran behind the guy dressed like a cowboy for a good chunk of this segment (apparently he was going for some record? I didn’t try to scan his instagram QR code during the race for obvious reasons). The hills were tough but I was well prepared since I’ve done this segment several times. I felt pretty strong so I decided to leave the 3:15:00 group and push towards the 3:10:00 group at around mile 11. After the steep climb at mile 12, the half marathoners split off and I joined the cowboy up towards UT campus direction. I saw my wife for the second time just before the turn which gave me a nice boost of energy in anticipation of what’s to come next.\n\nMiles 13-20\n\nThe field and crowd immediately thinned out after the turn, and the next two miles were gentle ascent with slight headwind. I slowly picked off runners, using them as temporary wind barriers until they got annoyed and moved out of my way. I chatted with one of the runners as he was pretty much shoulder-to-shoulder for a mile or two. After learning he was targeting sub-3:30:00, I let him know the 3:15:00 pacer was still behind us and he was going to get a big PR, and continued on to try to reach the 3:10:00 group. At this point it was near the top of the climb and most of the ascent of the course was over by then. At about mile 17 on the bottom of Dean Keaton, I started noticing the banner in the distance. I checked my watch and found out I was ahead of schedule by 2 minutes, so I just let the gap close very slowly in preparation for the final push. Miles 18-20 were net downhill, so I ended up catching the pacers and past them rather quickly. Although it was quiet along this stretch the fast pacing downhill made it quite nice to run.\n\nMiles 21-26\n\nWith the 3:10:00 pacers behind me, I realized I had a nice buffer to my goal time. Miles 22-25 were pretty flat, and my Garmin strategy wants me to run 6:59 min/mile here. I was very wary of the pace before the race, as my lactate threshold was around 6:55 min/mile based on training runs (Garmin was even worse at 7:10 min/mile… lol). The head wind also started picking up as I headed towards the finish, my pace was >7:10 min/mile from mile 24 onward. I slowed even more as the turns up north were met with very strong headwinds. Fortunately, these parts were very short and I only lost about 1 minute compared to my pacing strategy. Still, I was absolutely tanking and tried to hype myself up with small shouts. I skipped the gel at mile 24 and instead took a sip of the BPN electrolyte that was handed out on course. I took a quick glimpse to the left as I ran along Red River St and absolutely dreaded what was about to come - the monster hill at 11th St. The course designer who put this stupidly steep hill on mile 25.9 is just pure evil. And sure enough this part was filled with spectators who had a blast watching me gut it out to the top. There was no amount of shouting or cheering that helped ease my pain or my anger towards the course design. I somehow managed to keep running, albeit at 9:00 min/mile pace, and reached the top of the hill. It was an immediate downhill, and miraculously I regained some strength to sprint towards the finish line. Some guy darted in front of me about 100 m from the finish line, and I tried to chase him but realized I had no strength to match his speed. I saw the time as I crossed the finish line, 3:09:00, besting my goal time by about a minute. I waited a little for the 3:15:00 pacer and thanked him for giving me the confidence to try for a lofty goal that I set at the beginning of the training block and a time I didn’t think I would achieve in a year’s time. Then I met up with my wife and smashed that PR gong as hard as I could.\n\n### What’s Next\n\nMy eventual goal is to one day qualify for Boston, which is probably <2:55:00 for my age group. I think with a flat/downhill course with perfect conditions I may be able to do so by the end of the next training block. But for now, I want to work on my speed, as my VDOT equivalents for sub-10k distances were well below 50. I think I need to be able to run strides in sub-5 min/mile pace if I am to hold a 6:50 min/mile marathon pace; I top out at about 5:15 min/mile strides at the moment. I will likely do a HM training block next to gain some speed, then back to a marathon training block. That takes me to August, which unfortunately does not have many good race options. But perhaps I may improve enough to be capable of BQ on a tougher course?\n \n\n\nTL;DR: In one year, 2:13:00 HM > Pfitz 18/55 > 4:00:00 M > Hansons Advanced > 1:33:00 HM > Pfitz 18/70 > (3:25:00 M 4 weeks before Austin’s) 3:09:00 Austin Marathon\n\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

I had such a fun time out yesterday and I absolutely love the community spirit of these types of events. \n\n### Training\nI (27f) am a relatively new runner, with a background in swimming. I'd never done an official race longer than the 5mi turkey trot last November - so this was uncharted territory. I'd never run regularly before, but these past ~3months have really made me fall in love with it.\nI followed the Nike Run Club marathon training plan, starting at 12 weeks out. I followed it pretty closely until about 4 weeks ago when I took 12 days off running with a very sore IT band. My biggest weekly volume was about 33 miles, with my longest run at 18.5mi. I had to miss my longest 'long run' with the IT band injury, and was pretty worried about taking time off - but it turns out that was a good move and I healed up pretty well with some rest. \n\n### Pre-race\nI am an Austin-local so luckily didn't have to travel for this race. I did a 15min run on Friday as a shakeout and rested Saturday with plenty of carbs (rice, potatoes). \n\nMorning of the run I woke up at 5am and had a blueberry bagel, a banana and 2 black coffees. I took a couple Imodium and prayed I wouldn't have to use the toilet on the course (by some miracle I didn't). I left home around 6:00am on my ebike, and rode the ~10 minutes to the course start. I was able to park my bike very close to the course which was awesome. I had a hoodie and some sweatpants to stay warm before the race that I left with my bike. I settled on gloves, a long sleeve and shorts for the run, along with my Hoka Rocket X shoes. Starting temps were around 40 with lots of wind - and I think I was well dressed for it. \n\nMy nutrition plan for the run was to have a pack of jelly belly sport beans every 6 miles or so, and have some water at most aid stations. I had a packet at the start, and then 4 packets of sport beans through the run (100 cals and 50mg caffeine in each). I had a couple sips of water at each station except for the first and last couple. This ended up working really well and I didn't feel that I had too much or too little water/nutrition.\n\n### Race\nI started in the middle of corral B - about 8:00 back from the gun. First couple of miles were definitely congested, but I typically start pretty slow so I was fine with a couple of 9:10 miles to get started. My goal was to stick to 8:45 mile pace to allow some cushion for the 4:00 attempt, but when I found myself even with the 4:20 pace group after a mile I started to think I was going too slow. I picked up the pace a bit and parted ways with my friends that I had been running with. \n\nI was in such a great mood running through the streets of Austin, feeling good, loving the bands, signs, fans, and clear morning sky. I didn't have any earphones in at all yesterday - the sights and sounds were more than enough. I glanced down at my watch every now and then and started to see I was steadily gaining time on my goal pace (shoutout apple watch pace features - this was awesome). Around the 10 mile mark I was feeling good, and started to target 3:40 as my goal time. It was all feeling pretty effortless, a lot easier than all the training runs and my heart-rate was comfortable below 150bpm. Ticked through the halfway point feeling good, and was slowly catching up and passing each pace group - which was a great little confidence boost. At about mile 18-19 I thought about how awesome it would be to get near the 3:30 mark - but I didn't let myself get too carried away with that idea because I didn't want to get disappointed if I hit a wall and started to struggle. By some miracle it just all really came together yesterday - I felt strong, happy, comfortable. In my long runs I typically get out of breath and my heartrate always creeps up into the high 160s. Yesterday my heart-rate was hovering around 150bpm and I wasn't feeling puffed at all. I expected cardio to be the limiter yesterday but surprisingly that was not the case.\n\nAt around mile 23 I got a cramp in my left hip flexor - and started worrying that I would have to really struggle through the last 5k (maybe even walk). I had just passed the 3:40 pace group so I knew if I stayed ahead of them I would be at least 3:32. That became the goal! I tucked in behind another runner and just stared at his feet mindlessly trying to ignore the pain. Fortunately the pain subsided after about 5mins and I was able to pick it back up. I felt I had plenty in the tank so I was able to keep dropping time and ran up the final hill feeling stoked. The energy from the crowd was amazing and the whole event just felt like a great celebration of life. \n\n### Post-race\nMet up with some amazing friends and headed to a beer garden for some celebratory food, drinks, and music. I was so pumped up on adrenaline, and probably had a bit too much fun - but that's showbiz. Still riding the endorphins.\n\nLegs are feeling very dusty today of course, but I think I might be hooked on marathons. I feel like I probably could have gone a bit harder earlier - but I was worried about crashing out in my first marathon. With some experience now under my belt I'm looking forward to the next one.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "Caution: I'm a yapper. \n\n### Race information\n* **What?** Austin Marathon\n* **When?** February 16, 2025\n* **How far?** 26.2 miles\n* **Where?** Austin, TX\n* **Finish time:** 3:51:31\n* **Gear:** My beloved Vaporfly 2s\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | < 4:00 | *Yes* |\n| B | Don't walk (except for aid stations) | *Yes* |\n| C | Don't hit the wall | *Yes* |\n| D | Finish | *Yes* |\n\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 13.1 | 1:55:59 |\n| 26.2 | 1:55:32 |\n\n### Training\n\nI've (mid-20s F) been running since April 2023, when I did my first 5K (after \"training\" for about one week, because I thought the race was actually in May...). Two months later, I ran another one and cut 3 minutes off my time (<25:00). I think that's when I realized I could be pretty ok at this. I'm also very stubborn and tend to like things that I can get better at basically through willpower and overplanning alone. I ran several local 5/8/10K races, even winning a few, and started aiming for the half distance with the eventual goal of completing a half Iron Man, since running was the piece I had never really done. \n\nIn August 2023, I ran my first half and came in just under my 2:00 goal.  I've run two half marathons since (and paid for a third that was rained out ☹️), with a PR of 1:49 from my most recent one in February 2024. And although I told myself I wouldn't do a full anytime soon due to the time and training requirements... a friend started her running journey and intended to train for the Austin Half, and I decided that if I was going to travel for a race, it might as well be the Big One. \n\nI loosely followed Hal Higdon's Marathon Novice 2 plan. His half plans have netted me continuous PRs and were on the lower mileage side, so I figured I'd stick to it. This had me peak at around 40 mpw. I generally made up most runs I skipped due to work/fatigue (but not injuries/sickness), but I certainly missed a few. I was a little worried I didn't have the training volume/speed in me to meet my goal, but I tend to really pull it out for races, so I felt OK going into it. I also twisted my ankle on a speed bump while sprinting one week before my peak run (20 mi) which made me a little nervous that it might pop up again during the race, so I tapered hard (aka basically stopped running for the last week, not sure if I recommend that though).\n\nFor my long runs, I wore my favorite training shoes, the NB FuelCell SuperComp Trainer v2. For my short and speed runs, I rotated between Nike Pegasus 37, Pegasus Trail 4 for rain/trails, and Brooks Adrenaline GTS for stability. \n\n### Pre-race\n\nI arrived in Austin on Thursday afternoon and attended the official shakeout run early Friday morning. It was on gravel and I kept my race pace for the 4.7ish miles (I got lost) but it felt a little rough. Later that day, my ankle flared up and I couldn't even walk normally. I slapped on like 6 Salonpas patches and took ibuprofen AND naproxen (also not recommended for general audiences) and slept with my foot up on 3 pillows. I was pretty worried I wouldn't be able to run without pain and bought some athletic tape for stability stirrups just in case. Saturday was basically a full day of sitting on the couch, rolling out my legs, stretching, eating bread and pasta and candy, drinking water and electrolytes, and praying that my ankle would be OK. Positive: this race has a great expo! Very well organized overall! Love the shirt swap. \n\nOn race morning, I woke up early, took 2 Imodium and an Aleve, ate 2 stinger waffles, and taped up my ankle. I ended up taking the tape off after my warmup because it was straining my arch, and I'm very glad I did. \n\n### Race\n\nI started at the very back of A group so I wouldn't feel pressured to go out fast. I was hoping to run negative splits for the first time in my life and I knew the first three miles were uphill - I'd make it up on the downhill coming back. I saw the 4:00 pacers on the way up and kept them in view, but made sure to stay behind them so I knew I was taking it easy. However... I was faster than my target pace for nearly every split; I tried to slow down a bit, but I was feeling good. At some point, I passed the 4:00 group and the first 13.1 went by pretty casually, with the exception of the first Big Hill at mile 12 and a sharp pain in my toe that I elected to ignore. \n\nI felt pretty fabulous through mile 17-18 despite the rolling hills and although I intended to walk through aid stations for water, I didn't until then. I had a huge smile on my face practically from mile 15 through 21-22, except for when a truck pulled out of a driveway right onto the course and almost hit a guy (🖕). Once I hit mile 21, I started feeling it in my legs, and I walked two or three more aid stations. Sometime around here, I caught up with the 3:55 pace group and started counting down the miles, which were getting longer and longer. Right around mile 25, I overtook the pacers and entered the longest mile of my LIFE, interrupted in the middle by the second Big Hill that I had read about, looked at the elevation profile, and compared to hills I run regularly at home. None of that prepared me. It was long and brutal. I even tried to walk at one point, but my legs went jelly and I had to keep my stride. Once I crested the hill, I let loose down the other side and rounded the corner to the finish, where I pulled a sprint out of the depths of my soul and finished with gusto. I definitely teared up a bit. It felt like the happiest I'd ever been in my life. Was this finally runner's high?? And it only took a full marathon to get there... And I hit negative splits!! Just barely but it counts!!\n\nI credit my (over)fueling plan for my lack of hitting the wall and general keep-going-ability: a gel at the start line and every 3 miles, alternating caf and non-caf, and sipping Tailwind continuously throughout. I had some unflavored gels on hand in case I couldn't stomach a Gu late in the race, but I was just fine with my usual!\n\nAlso, my watch died at some point near the end, so I'm extra glad they had timers at every 5 km. \n\n### Post-race\n\nI saw lots of people sitting on the ground and felt like, could I have gone harder? But while my lungs were great and my mind was OK, my legs were toast. More strength next training cycle, I guess. I got my goodies and met up with my friends who had finished the half just a few minutes earlier. We were planning to do BBQ, but with 23,000 people running today, it was no surprise that everywhere had a 2 hour wait. So we got tacos instead. 😊 Also, I found out that the toe pain around halfway through was a huge blood blister right under the nail, probably from all the downhills. Yayyyy.\n\nFinishing thoughts: it's a great race with spectacular crowd energy, lots of music, and some extremely creative signage. It is pretty hilly though. I'm lucky (debatable) to live in an area that's pretty much all hills, or I would've had a Bad Time, especially with this as my first! 10/10 experience and would recommend the Austin Marathon! Just be prepared for a teensy lil bit of suffering!"

I’ve attempted to take training more seriously for the past 1.5 years. Have run 7 half marathons over the course of the past 20 years. Prior to this race, my half marathon PR was 1:33:15 (in 2016). Ran my first full marathon in NYC in November 2024 (3:26:31). Currently registered for the REVEL White Mountains Marathon in May and Berlin Marathon in September. My goal is to qualify for Boston in one of these next two races (3:15:00).\n\nI am currently following the Pfitz 18/55 plan. The Mesa Half Marathon marked the end of Week 6 of that 18-week plan. In the lead up to the race I have told myself that I would take this half seriously but my plan has been to treat it as part of my marathon training and not as an endpoint in itself. I have been running approximately 40 miles per week since the first week of December. I didn’t incorporate a very structured taper for this race but I did slightly lighter midweek mileage during race week. My last long run was 8 days before the race (16 miles).\n\nTraining has been going generally well. I live in Maine. Due to cold and icy conditions, I have completed about 50% of my training runs on a treadmill. As an older runner and one who is newer to more structured training, the major challenge has been to increase mileage while keeping the risk of injury as low as possible. Have had some slight but ongoing discomfort in my right hamstring and Achilles tendon but have managed to keep those discomforts from developing into anything more debilitating so far in this training block. I try to do basic strength training about twice a week. I would like to develop that component of my training more in coming weeks. Would also like to incorporate some dynamic stretching and form exercises, which I have largely neglected.\n\nI train almost exclusively in the Hoka Skyward X. I have gout and hallux rigidus (stiff big toe arthritis). The stiff plate, aggressive rocker, and cushioning have helped mitigate the symptoms of those conditions but so far I have had two disruptions in my training plan due to flares that left me unable to run for around 1-3 days each time.\n\n### Pre-race\n\nArrived in AZ on Wednesday night. Attended the race expo on Friday afternoon. The expo was fairly standard. Hoka was showing off the new Cielo X1 2.0 and some of the pros were there giving talks and offering tips. Not a lot of swag but good energy and efficient setup. I was staying in downtown Phoenix so it was about a thirty minute car ride to get there. I did not attempt to take public transportation. Took a Lyft to and from, which added about $60 to the race expenses for me.\n\nI tried to be diligent with hydration during the day on Friday. Also carb loaded on Thursday and Friday (rice, bagels, and pasta). Was in bed with my race-day bag fully prepped by 9:00 p.m. on Friday night.\n\nI woke up at 4:00 a.m. for the scheduled 6:30 a.m. start time. Surprisingly, I slept very well. I’m definitely prone to pre-race jitters so I was happy that I was somehow able to shut my brain down and get a full night of sleep. For breakfast, I had about half a cup of coffee with a bagel, peanut butter, and half a banana. Drank a full glass of water and sipped a sports drink on the commute to the starting line.\n\nTraffic on race morning was a total disaster. Unlike the marathon and 10K races (held the same day and time but with different starting locations), there was no bussing available to the start for half marathoners. My wife and I planned to arrive at the staging area at 5:15 a.m. The driving routes to the starting line were extremely backed up. We arrived just before 6:00 a.m. The commute that should have taken about 20 minutes took over an hour. Instead of getting my race shoes (Nike Alphafly 3) on at the staging area, I dressed hurriedly in the car. Not the ideal way to get started but I hit the porta potty (with just a modest wait) and arrived at the start with time to spare. Race organizers ultimately delayed the start time by 15 minutes. I had plenty of time to warm up, secure my race kit, and get my head right for the race. The race started without other notable surprises at 6:45 a.m.\n\n### Race\n\nTemperatures were in the low 50s in the morning. Cold for Arizonans but near optimal running weather in my opinion. Because of the early start and because the bulk of the course points west, I opted for a cap instead of sunglasses. I was happy with that choice. There was maybe a half mile stretch around mile 9-10 where we ran toward the sun but otherwise it was at our backs or to the side and not particularly uncomfortable. Was really a beautiful morning with excellent conditions for a run!\n\nMy plan was to go out at around 7:25 pace and slowly chip away with a trend of negative splits over the course of the race. The course is very flat and actually loses about 200 feet in elevation from start to finish. I was well aware of this and wanted to take a conservative approach to avoid going out too fast and losing steam in the latter half of the race.\n\nThere were approximately 3900 runners in the half marathon. The race advertised pacers for 1:30 and 1:40 goal times but I did not see them at the start. There were not formal corrals but there were flags marking 1:30, 1:40, 1:50 etc. There was plenty of space to line up in front of the 1:40 flag. But because there were relatively few runners in front of the 1:40 marker it was a little tough to assess the crowd with which I was set to start. I did not want to get stuck behind a slower wave but I also didn’t want to get sucked in with runners who were significantly quicker than I am. It ended up being ok. I did get pulled out slightly faster than I intended to start (around 7:00 instead of 7:25) but I was able to remain grounded and moderate. I didn’t end up being at all detrimental to the rest of my race plan.\n\nI hydrated with sports drink at miles 4, 6, and 8 (I think). I had a few Honey Stinger gummies around mile 4. I took about half of an SiS gel at mile 7 and the rest at around mile 10.5. I felt the threat of slight GI discomfort so I opted to fuel slowly and conservatively to monitor how I was feeling. Fortunately, I made it through and averted any significant discomfort or GI crisis. (Note: There were aid stations about every other mile. Each had water and Gatorade. Several also offered Gu gels.)\n\nThe course was spacious and comfortable throughout. Not a ton of spectators but enough to infuse a steady flow of energy throughout the race. Aside from some very minor traffic at a couple aid stations, I was able to moderate my pace and stick to a plan without stride disruptions or any crowd related obstacles to navigate in the course. I did not have a large pack in my pace range to settle in with but was able to stick with a rotation of a dozen or so runners at various stages throughout the race to help gauge pace, maintain control, and stay consistent throughout. I read a few reviews that said the latter miles became a bit clogged with walkers in the 10K but, from what I observe, walkers stayed off to the side and the roadways were wide and open enough to run unencumbered throughout the race. (Note: Because the course was shared with the marathon and 10K, I thought mile markers and signage were slightly less than ideal. Not terrible but I do think a clearer system could help runners in each event track progress throughout the race.)\n\nBy mile 8 I was feeling generally good. I felt like I was in very good shape for my “C” goal and I was cautiously optimistic that my “B” goal—a new PR—was well within reach. I certainly felt some fatigue building after mile 9 or so but I was able to keep focused through mile 11 when I allowed myself to open up my stride a bit more as I pushed toward the final stretch. As I moved toward that final section of the race, I felt good physically and mentally and knew that I was on pace for a finish with which I would be quite happy. I ran my fastest splits in miles 12 and 13, and came through the finish with an emotional feeling of strength and euphoria. I crossed the finish line with a new PR, breaking the old one—which I ran in a much more youthful body over 9 years ago—by more than two minutes.\n\n### Post-race\n\nHitting a new PR at age 44, in the middle of a training block, and despite some health challenges I’ve confronted in the past five years, was a huge confidence boost. I feel strong and motivated to keep moving forward toward that BQ later this year. And, yes, I am feeling proud of the discipline and commitment that has gotten me to this place. I am so grateful for my health, my mobility, and the support of my incredible wife, which have all made this running journey possible for me. \n\nI’d absolutely recommend this half marathon to others who might be looking for a fast course with great weather during a winter training block.\n\nNext stop: Conway, New Hampshire!\n\nOnward!\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

I backed off, replaced my runs with walks and aggressive resting and thankfully it healed up quickly.  for a moment i was back on track, then one week pre race i got hit with some sort of cold, and was stuck in bed for about 3 days. I didn’t run at all the week before the race, by some stroke of luck I managed to recover the day before my flight out. \n\n### Pre-race\nThursday Morning I woke up ready for my flight freshly recovered from being ill. I go to turn off the alarm on my phone to find a series of text from my flight saying my flight was canceled, rebooked, then canceled again and that i had to rebook manually, I open the app to figure it out and see the news about the crash, (i was supposed to fly through DCA) I look at my rebooking options, the soonest available option would get me in at midnight Friday, a mere 6 hours before the race. I accepted the rebooking and threw my bags into my car anyways and headed to work with the resolve to keep rechecking every 15 mins hoping that something would eventually open up for today . After about 2 hours my persistence paid off and I managed to rebooked to get in midnight that Thursday. After lunch I grabbed my bags and walked myself over to the airport. I land in my destination just before the renal car place shuts I manage to grab my car then go crash at the hotel. \n\nFriday I wake up 15 mins before the end of the hotel breakfast, go for a shakeout walk, go to the grocery store, decide to take a gamble and pick up some nerd gummy clusters to mix in with my gummy worms, go to bib pickup and then spend the rest of the night packing my pack and drop back and laying out my clothes for the following Morning and trying to get to bed.\n\nOn Race morning i wake up at 3, shove 2 blueberry streusel muffins in my mouth get dressed, go to the bathroom, apply anti chafing and head out 3:50. On the drive I make a stop at a Wawa to try their much praised coffee and arrive at the shuttle with 5 mins to spare. I park, swap shoes, and run myself onto the bus. Just after the bus gets moving i realize in my rush i left my phone in the car so no pictures would be taken. We get to the start line, i hand in my drop bag and get in line for the bathroom then wait for the start.\n\n### Race\nStart to aide station 1 (about mile 0 to 14)\n\nrace started off well enough and was feeling good we start off with about 1 mile of roadway to try and thin out the group then we dived off onto single track. the next few miles were spent jockeying with other runners, shouting passing but also just chatting with the person in front of or behind you. I found a group that i thought were going a good pace and clung to them for a bit, eventually it opened back up to some double track and the people were off sorting out their paces again. nothing too exciting happened these miles. I tested my Nerd gummy clusters and they seemed Like they would be a welcome variation with the gummy worms.\n\naide station 1 to aide station 2 (about mile 14 to 18)\n\nI roll into the first aide station and start off with refilling my water and take a check of what foods they are carrying. almost everything except for applesauce pouches are heavier that what i trained with, I didn’t even see pretzels. thankfully i wasn’t planning on relying on it but was hoping for some stuff to switch things up later on in the race. after refilling my camelback, I’m off on the next section with is a little loop, not long after I run into the first real patch of mud, its a giant squishy waterlogged field, water is up over my shoes and I’m picking my way through this for about a mile. after that it dries back up to some nice sandy single track. thankfully the sand if fairly compact so running on it isn’t too bad. by the time i made it back to the aide station my shoes had mostly dried back out.\n\naide station 2 to aide station 4 (about mile 18 to 30)\n\nshortly after this aide station I find a good sport to pull off into the woods and try to go to the bathroom, I had been feeling constipated the whole run thus far and hoped i could get some out but all I managed to do was to pee and cover myself in little prickly seeds. (hey at least it meant i wasn’t dehydrated) I take back off running once i manage to remove all the prickers (including the ones that stuck into my underwear, and inside my shorts) more double track ahead and I’m starting to feel the unevenness of the terrain but still overall feeling good. that is until about mile 28 i mange to not pick up my foot quite enough for a root and bash my toenail on it. my toenail starts throbbing and i walk it out for about a mile till it calms down enough though it remains sensitive for the rest of the race. \n\naide station 4 to aide station 6 (about mile 30 to 41)\n\nah aide station number 4! this is the aide station with the drop bags and volunteers to help crew the crewless. i can not speak highly enough of these volunteers. they bring me to a chair and bring me my drop bag, one fills up my water for me while another helps me tape up my blisters. I re apply my anti chaffing and swap socks, refill my bag, grab an applesauce from the aide station, try using the porta potty again, thank the volunteers and head out on my way again. I manage to cruise the miles to aide station 5 where they tell me the big mud is coming up soon so to be ready for it. i head back off and pull out one of my heavier snacks figuring ill be walking soon for a bit so ill have some extra time to digest it. the miles keep ticking by and I’m wondering where is this mud? I start to wonder if maybe the conditions had been dry enough that it had dried up. Just when I convinced myself of this at about mile 40 bam there it is. Now I’m no stranger to running in mud but my jaw just dropped when I saw this. I had never seen a trail routed down something like this without a boardwalk installed in. i then spent the next 20 min picking my way through this about half mile of swamp trying desperately to keep my feet dryish as the way my feet felt mud in my shoes would have ended my race. thankfully I made it to the other side and not long after was the next aide station. \n\naide station 6 to aide station 8 (about mile 41 to 52)\n\nthis is where the pain started to really shine through. this aide station was also where they started handing out fireball. if I was a drinker I would have considered having some, anything to help ignore how sore my legs were. but alas I don’t so i filled up my water and carried on. up next was a quick out and back down a dirt road back past the aide station then back into the woods. this is where I finally did the math and realized I had zero chance of meeting my goal of finishing before dark. I found someone going about the same pace and for a few miles I was once again not alone. we talked and walked and occasionally jogged and i can’t remember a single word of what was talked about. after a road crossing where there a crew access point I lost my companion and carried on alone as he stopped for the crew. At this point my headlamp had to be pulled out, with darkness I slowed even more due to my terrible eyesight and not wanting to risk my toenail again. alone here in the dark is where my mind started go dark. I wanted to cry but couldn’t. I pulled off the trail for one last pee stop turned off my light to use the darkness as cover as the tree cover wasn’t as good. but because my quads were so blown I had to put a hand on the ground as I squatted. Halfway through peeing i must have shifted slightly and hit a leaf and my pee was suddenly redirected and shot forward onto my hand that that was holding me steady. once again I wanted to cry but couldn’t. soon my watch ticked over 50, surely we are getting close, i can run in this last less than 1 mile, little did i know how much more I had. several times I kept trying to cry I switched back to walking. eventually the last adie station appeared like a mirage out of the darkness.\n\naide station 7 to aide station 8 (about mile 52 to 52.5)\n\nWhat is it with ultras putting the last aide station so close to the end? i still had water so i passed the aide station and out of pure willpower i got myself running again it might have been closer to a speed walk but I just wanted to get everything over with and sit. I crossed the line and was immediately handed a medal and was ushered into a chair.\n\n### Post-race\nThe chair that i was ushered into had a little dog hanging out next to it. the person was about to move her away but I asked if I could hold/ pet her instead and he said absolutely. so I sat there for probably 20 mins petting this dog who fell asleep on my lap. Eventually I get enough energy to get my sandals from my car and ask about post race food only to find out there is no post race food at this event. All race I was looking at these bacon avocado wraps at these aide stations thinking how delicious they will be at the end to find out at the end they had nothing! I can honestly say that was a first. so next I muster up the energy to get in my car and head back to the hotel, stopping off at a Wawa again, this time to try their burritos. In conclusion I believe Wawa had better coffee but Sheetz is better for burritos. Eventually i get back to my room to find whoever had programmed my key card had programmed the wrong number of days and I had to waddle back down to the lobby and wait in a line to get my key reprogrammed. this is when i finally started crying, I was so close to rest that being thwarted by the key was the last straw. eventually i got into my room took a speedy shower, covered my legs in icy hot and fell asleep. \n\nAt this point Im still questioning the long term plan, initially this was to be a stepping stone race working towards a 100k but after this race I was questioning if I really have the drive to go to that level. After talking to multiple people I have decided to give the decision some time. Maybe ill need to do another 50M before leveling up or maybe ill just stick to 50k and less. Either way i got some time to decide. "

When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*\n\nThe mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.\n\nRegardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.\n\nWe are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.\n\n_____\n\n\n###**Recurring Threads**\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).\n\nHere are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  \n\n*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by \"Hot\" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by \"New\" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*\n\n* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!\n\n* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.\n\n* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jn4bar/the_weekly_training_thread/)\n\n* [Miscellaneous Monday General Chit-Chat (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jo2iaw/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat/)\n\n* [Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jnupqd/lil_race_report_thread/)\n\n* [Super Moronic Monday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jji9pk/super_moronic_monday_your_weekly_tuesday_stupid/)\n\n* [Run Nutrition Tuesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jjau4m/run_nutrition_tuesday/)\n\n* [Tuesday Shoesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jjau4f/tuesday_shoesday/)\n\n* [Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jk37l1/lurkers_wednesday/)\n\n* [What Are You Wearing Wednesday Weekly Gear Thread (Wednesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jk37l9/what_are_you_wearing_wednesday_weekly_gear_thread/)\n\n* [Weekly Complaints & Confessions Thread (Thursdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jl2tne/weekly_complains_confessions_thread/)\n\n* [The Weekend Thread (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jltm8z/the_weekend_thread_28th_march_2025/)\n\n* [Race Roll Call (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jlmipi/race_roll_call/)\n\n* [Social Saturday (Saturdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jme12w/social_saturday/)\n\n_____\n\n###**Rules**\nWe have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.\n\n **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  \n\nThis sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.\n\nIf you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Current MPW + pace\n\n* Previous peak MPW\n\n* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed\n\n* Goals (including specific races)\n\n* Previous PRs\n\n* Other things you think might be helpful to include\n\nBelow are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:\n\n* \"Does anyone else...\" type posts?\n\n* \"Is X a good time for...?\" posts\n\n* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).\n\n* If your question can be asked in one sentence.\n\n* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.\n\n* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.\n\n* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  \n\n* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.\n\nFinally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.\n\n\n **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  \n\nWhile there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  \n\nThere is a big difference between \"Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?\" and \"My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?\" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.\n\nAlso, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.\n\n_____________________\n\n\nFinally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.\n\n###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**",

I'd love any recommendations on running trails, not sure if I'll run too much but thinking maybe 5km like once a week (I'll be there three weeks).\n\nI'm also looking for any gear/item recommendations. I know Japan has a big running culture, so I'm wondering if there's anything that are running-related I can only get from Japan (aside from Asics). Like a deodorant, sunscreen, running pouch, etc. or some specific device that only the Japanese have thought of. Not sure if these exists, but I thought I'd ask anyway.\n\nTIA!",

Was a college baseball player, and ran my first HM in 2012. But let myself get out of shape over the years before deciding to do something about it. Have lost 60ish pounds since 2022 (down to 185lbs at 5’10” with some more to lose, but still feel great where I’m at), and tremendously improved my fitness. Ran my first HM in over a decade in May, and while I was big picture ecstatic with a 1:38:33, it was on a course (La Jolla) with a huge incline in Mile 5ish that I took way too hard and it destroyed me and my hopes of low 1:30’s. So I signed up for the Rose Bowl Half Marathon (more on that in a bit) on a slightly flatter course with plenty of time to get ready, in hopes of chasing a 7min pace and a finish that didn’t involve run-walking the last couple miles.\n\nIn October I tackled a half marathon trail race in the Channel Islands with 2500ft of ascent in just over 2 hours, so was able to leverage that training into starting my training for this race. Felt confident moving up to Higdon advanced training from the Higdon intermediate I’d been using. Looking back, it was kind of shocking how intense the training was; 6 days on per week with some kind of workout on 2-3 of those days plus a long run on Sunday. The last 5 full weeks were all between 35 and 40 mpw, with a ton of those miles at sub threshold or faster. With a stated goal time plugged into the app of 1:32 (7:00/mi), by the last full week before what was allegedly a taper, my training looked like:\n\nSunday: simulated 15k race @ 6:40/mi (knocked out new 10k and 15k PRs) with 1 mile warm up, 1 mile cool down.\n\nMonday: 3 miles @ “base” (ie 7:23/mi)\n\nTuesday: 5 miles @ HM Pace (which Higdon had updated to 6:45 w/o my consent!)\n\nWednesday: 3 miles @ base\n\nThursday: 55 minute tempo (with middle 40 minutes at 6:30-7:00 min pace)\n\nFriday: 4x1600m intervals at a recommended pace of 5:45/mi!! My 5k PR, which would certainly be better now, was 6:11/mi. There was also about 3.5 miles of warmup/cool down.\n\nSaturday: Rest\n\nSunday: 3:1 long run for 2 hours @ aggregate pace of 7:12/mi. Which meant 16.7 miles!! at very close to goal pace\n\nNot surprisingly, I didn’t get through Friday’s workout without serious modifications. Felt like crap all day Friday and Saturday (may have also gotten sick from my toddlers), and then slogged through the long run at over an 8minute pace. Which is probably what it should have been anyway, but felt bad given the Higdon suggestion.\n\nBut darn if the next week of training wasn’t incredible. Flew through the workouts, felt amazing on my last long run (15.2 miles at 7:45 pace) a week before race. Garmin and Higdon were both predicting finishes in around 1:28. And I had just bought my first ever pair of carbon plated shoes (Endorphin Pro 4s) which felt amazing on a 3 mile HM pace run. So I was cautiously optimistic that I’d be able to knock out all of my goals.\n\nOnly problem? Wildfires in Los Angeles which devastated so many communities (and left multiple close friends temporarily homeless) forced a postponement of the Rose Bowl Half due to air quality concerns. Comparatively insignificant impact of those awful fires, obviously, but nevertheless left me in an awkward position peaking during training.\n\nSo I went online and looked up So Cal races for the same weekend, and found the Carlsbad HM. Only 390’ of total ascent, an out and back course with 8 miles along the water in beautiful San Diego, and a nice hotel room the night before without a 1.5 year old who’s been waking up in the middle of the night for the last month? Aw shucks, guess that’ll work.\n\n\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nI drove down to San Diego from my house in Los Angeles the day before, cruised by the bib pickup and expo (great swag!), and visited some old friends and their baby. Checked into my beautiful hotel on the water in Oceanside, grabbed a nice meal, and was in bed by 9:30pm. Unsurprisingly didn’t make it to my 5:50 alarm, but while my Whoop said my recovery wasn’t great, I felt well rested and ready to race. Had a cold brew, banana, and half a granola bar before heading out.\n\nThe event included a full marathon which went off at 6:30am, but the HM didn’t start until 7:45. So it was nice having a bit of time to get down there, park, get loose, stay warm (in the 40s F is cold for us Southern California folks!) without feeling rushed or like it was too early. Forecast looked perfect – cool and sunny.\n\nLined up with the 1:30 pacers in Wave 1 (yay for tiered starts! Such a smooth starting process); the plan was to stick with them for at least the first 5 or so miles and then see if I felt good enough to break away and shoot for a more aggressive time.\n\n\\### Race\n\nWent off with the 1:30 pacers (ie an overall 6:51/6:52 pace) and we started quick; first mile was 6:34, which I chalked up to early race adrenaline. Then we ran a 6:28 second mile which was a tad downhill, but still hot and we were losing folks. I felt great, personally, but found it odd we could still see the 1:25 group not too far ahead. Over the next few miles, and after I mentioned something to the pacer, we finally settled down to a 6:50 mile 5. But at that point, it was clear my body was more than comfortable pushing at around a 6:40 pace, so I left the group behind. Didn’t hurt that by Mile… 3, I think, we were running along the ocean in absolutely perfect conditions. And there were some great cheerleaders along the way.\n\nIt was also pretty cool starting to see marathoners making their way on the course. Because they did two loops of the bulk of the ocean stretch, we got to see just about everyone along the way – the leaders down to the party pacers. Great vibes all around and lots of encouragement flowing both ways.\n\nAt the halfway point I did some simple math and figured I was on pace for around 1:27 and still feeling good. Didn’t register at the time, but I actually finished the first 10k at a new PR in the 40min range.\n\nFrom halfway on, I actually picked up pace a tad and ran some great, consistent miles 8 through 11, and started passing folks. I don’t think I was passed once after the halfway turn, which was a huge psychological lift after getting passed by about 100 folks in my prior PR HM over the last 5 miles.\n\nMile 12 I started to pick up the pace with the end in sight. Still feeling really strong. Then Mile 13 I really picked it up, and ran a blazing 6 minute mile. I actually passed the 1:25 pacer during this stretch, who had fallen back a bit. Came around the turn to a cheering crowd of folks, including my wife and two boys, and crossed the finish line at 1:26:37. Don't have the \\*exact\\* data, but almost certain I ran a negative split for the first time ever on a race longer than a 10k.\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI was absolutely ecstatic with my time, and shocked tbh. My wife barely made it in time with the kids, because I had assured her I wouldn’t be faster than 1:28. And my body felt leaps and bounds better than it had after my last two HM attempts. Like I actually may have left some out on the course. But I wouldn’t change anything about how I ran it. I think if I was actually only capable of a 1:30, I would have been pissed at the pacers for going out so hot, but it worked out tremendously well for me and gave me the confidence to really go for it. \n\nI didn't quite get the hero's welcome I was hoping for; my 1.5 year old got upset because I held him before drying off (understandable, my bad). And my 3 year old was angry and sullen, because he thought he was going to be able to run the whole race with me. Five minutes of silence and avoidance was finally solved by getting to feast on my post-race treats with me. And then we went and had a nice brunch and beach day before heading back home, and all was right in the world. An absolutely perfect day.\n\nI joked to my wife that my finish was actually bad news for her; there was no doubt now that I was completely obsessed with running. And that training going forward was probably only going to increase. I've got my first marathon in October, and hoping to steadily ramp up my weekly mileage for the next few months so I can dive into a more advanced training plan ahead of the race. \n\nWhen I first signed up, my goal was 3:30. Then saw a buddy run a 3:25 at CIM for his first, and that was my new goal. As training started going well, and looking at my Garmin predictions, I started thinking 3:15 or maybe even 3:10 would be doable. And of course, as I write this still high on the thrill of obliterating my PR, I have a preposterous notion that I can shoot for a sub 3:00. Until someone who knows what they're talking about convinces me otherwise (please, anyone, feel free), that's the pie in the sky goal.\n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

        "Texto": "This weekend I (40M) ran the Dopey Challenge at Disney World with my partner (30F). This challenge consists of a 5k on Thursday, a 10k on Friday, a half marathon on Saturday, and a Marathon on Sunday.\n\n**Background**  \nMy partner and I have some experience in endurance events. We've run the Houston Marathon, Des Moines Marathon, Ironman Chattanooga, Wilderman Triathlon, and a lot of half marathons and half Ironmans. This was our first time doing any of the runDisney races.\n\n**Training**  \nTo train up for this quartet of races, we did a simple ramp up of mileage starting in October. Our weekly volume wasn't crazy, as our training in other sports has some carryover. We went from about 6 mi/week up to about 16 mi/week before I broke my toe doing BJJ two weeks before the races started (which made this run a bit more difficult). I ran only one mile the week before the race just to see how it would feel to put on shoes.\n\n**Planning and Goals**  \nKnowing that this was going to be more of a survival event than a race, and having an injured foot, I did not have a goal of PRing anything. My own goal going in was to hit an 8/9/10/11 minute miles on each event (5k/10k/13.1/26.2), thinking that this was conservative enough that no race would smoke me, and I could avoid waking up any niggling overuse injuries from the past.\n\n**Thursday, January 9th - Walt Disney World 5K**  \nWe were told that traffic would be a nightmare, so we woke at 3am, threw on shorts, a t-shirt, a long-sleeve shirt, anti-chafing cream, and headed out by 3:30. Traffic turned out not to be a problem, so we got there just before 4.\n\nThe walk from the parking lot to the start line is very long (maybe a half-mile). You're directed through security at Epcot (there are bathrooms here), through the finish area (where Gear Check is), then to the start Corrals in the Epcot parking lot.\n\nFor all of the races, runners are divided into corrals A through F, and they start a couple hundred people at a time in waves (4 or 5 waves per corral). We started in Corral E, which I didn't think would be a problem, as I'm pretty good at dodging and weaving past people.\n\nRace morning was a chilly and windy 41°F - and our wave didn't start until 5:43. Getting there before 4 and freezing for so long was a big mistake that we corrected for in the following days.\n\nWhat shocked us most was watching the A-wave start. It looked like at least half of them were walkers! It seems that there was some way to pay yourself into the A-wave. We learned that this 5k is a **very** casual race. It was totally about the experience rather than your time.\n\nFor background, I tend to be around 21 minutes for a 5k. My goal was to stroll through this one in about 24 minutes, saving my legs for the next 3 days.\n\nAs soon as our wave was released (with fireworks and Pluto!) I realized that any time goals had to be thrown out the window. It was an absolute **wall** of people from start to finish. There were very few spots even wide enough to run in the grass to pass people. I estimate that there around 10,000 people crammed into 3 miles.\n\nIn spite of this, the route was amazing. At about mile 1.2 (through the parking lot), you enter Epcot. I caught up to my partner here (she's a bit better at slipping through crowds) and we just ran it together and enjoyed the run. It's at night and the scene and atmosphere are beautiful. The 5k was vintage-themed and had a lot of amazing old-school music from the 40's and 50's all along the route. One thing I quickly figured out was there were lines forming everywhere. I thought it was for bathrooms, but apparently there were characters all along the route you could get photos with. That was the case for all of the races. Unfortunately, the walkers on this race had no care in the world for anyone trying to run. Portions of the races were 4-wide or 6-wide with walkers blocking the entire path. So we gave up an cruised together to a 30 minute 5k finish.\n\n**Friday, January 10th - Walt Disney World 10K**  \nWe woke up and arrived about 40 minutes later for this race than the day before, leaving our car and walking up to E corral just before they closed. This ended up being perfect, as we minimized our standing-around time in the cold (the temperature was similar, but less wind) and were able to shuffle through to the start line and get on the road (started again, by Pluto and fireworks).\n\nI tend to be around 47 minutes on a 10k, but after that 5k experience the previous day, I threw my time and pacing out the window and just went as fast as the crowd would allow.\n\nThe route for the 10k overlaps a lot with the 5k. They add a sort of out-and-back on some of the entry roads to get the distance, and added the Boardwalk and a loop around Crescent Lake to get the distance. The worst choke point was the bridge coming back into the park from the highway. We were slowed down to a shuffle here.\n\nThis race, much like the 5k, also had a cool nostalgic feel to it. We were able to finish in just over 1 hour (10 min/mi) - a bit slower than our 5k pace.\n\n**Saturday, January 11th - Walt Disney World Half Marathon**  \nThe big difference on this race was that the start was warmer than all of the others, although it was raining a bit when we started, and sprinkled on us during the run. It was a tad over 60°F, so I wore just a t-shirt and shorts. This was starting to get to the point where conserving our bodies for the next day was important - so we aimed for 11 min/miles. For reference, I tend to be around 1:40 for a half (under 8 min/mi), so this is a very chill pace. By now, my broken toe was having words with me, so it wasn't **as** chill as I would have hoped. Our start wave this time (for both the half and the full) was the D corral. Which didn't seem to make a huge difference in the crowding.\n\nI tried wearing my Shokz headphones for this run - but the route is so loud almost the entire way that I gave up on them. Between the music, DJs, announcers, spectators and volunteers, you never really have a chance to go internal.\n\nThe route is a run to Magic Kingdom, and runs through Epcot again on the way back. The first \\~5 miles is just on the highway to MK, and, while the road conditions are excellent, they have a steep slant that will cause some of your asymmetric leg and foot pains to wake up. Once you get to MK, the path turns into a **super** narrow sidewalk, and you just have to slow down and enjoy the experience.\n\nThere was only one food stop on this route, and it was a pack of caffeinated jelly beans at mile 8.5.\n\nThe wall of bodies wasn't as bad on this race. Once we got past the highway on-ramp at mile 2, we could cruise pretty comfortably until the bottlenecks at Magic Kingdom.\n\nTurning onto Main Street during this race to the lights and the noise and the crowds and the lit-up Cinderella's castle in the distance has got to be in the top-3 experiences in my running career. It's sensory overload, but in a good way.\n\nWe ended up finishing comfortably at just over 2:30.\n\n**Sunday, January 12th - Walt Disney World Marathon**  \nThis was the big-kahuna of the weekend. Up to this point, we weren't even halfway done with the Dopey mileage, and we were hurting a bit from the past 3 days. I had no specific time goals for this - as I just wanted to cruise and enjoy the race with my partner.\n\nThis race started 30 minutes earlier than the others, so we got up at 2:30 to get ready and drive in. We again arrived at our corral just a few minutes before they started shuffling to the start line.\n\nThe crowd on this race was less casual than the other races. There is a sweeper at the end that will pick you up if you're too slow, so there were far fewer walkers. And those that did run/walk were more courteous with indicating and moving to the right.\n\nMy nutrition ended up being just 2 gels, 2 bananas, and one chocolate biscuit thing. There are more snack stops on this day than any of the other races:  \nMile 6.5: jellybeans  \nMile 13.4: bananas  \nMile 17.2: bananas  \nMile 21.4: jellybeans  \nMile 23.2: chocolate covered wafers (yum!)\n\nThe route starts out with a little loop on the highway, then a dip through Epcot, then back out onto the highway to Magic Kingdom. You go through MK just like the half (with the same bottlenecks), then do a lot of zig-zagging in the parking lot (the most magical parking lot on Earth) before heading down to Animal Kingdom. On the way to Animal Kingdom, there's a huge Star Wars themed area with smoke, battle sounds, and characters that is super cool. You also pass the garbage dump and a sewage treatment plant - which smell wonderful! Before entering Animal Kingdom, we met a cute little opossum named \"Applesauce\".\n\nBy this time the parks were opening, and we got to run by all sorts of park-goers curious about what was going on. After leaving AK, we ran over the Blizzard Beach and did a loop in the parking lot before heading over to Hollywood Studios. This is where we started to see some people giving up or bonking.\n\nWe ran through Epcot (again) and to the finish! We were just over 5:30 on the marathon, and I didn't feel totally spent like some of the other marathons I've done. I ended up pretty mid-pack in the military division, and my partner finished towards the top of the female military division.\n\nAnd with this, we finished the 48.6 miles! We collected our medals (3 of them! Marathon, Goofy Challenge, and Dopey Challenge) for a neck-breaking total of 6 crazy cool medals for the weekend. Our total Dopey time was around 9:42.\n\n**Some miscellaneous notes**\n\n1. All of the courses measured long. I measured the half at 13.4 miles, and the full at 26.7 miles. That extra half-mile at the end of a marathon will be disheartening to some.\n2. All of the routes were flat and fast. The only hills we encountered were the overpasses and underpasses.\n3. You have a lot of time to kill after the 5k. We went and watched a SpaceX rocket launch. There's no shortage of things to do around Orlando, so plan on doing something chill. After the half, we just spent our time recovering.\n4. Disney is the *master* of crowd control. I feel like they packed the absolute maximum number of people into these races without making it a completely miserable experience (although the 5k was borderline). From start to finish they have it planned out. You are corralled to the start line, through the race course, through the finish line, and back to your bus/car/train as smoothly as can be. And they have the staff and volunteers to ensure that it never becomes a clogged up gaggle at the start or finish.\n5. These races are an *experience* more than any other race we've ever done. The atmosphere, the music, the characters, the announcers - everything comes together to build something more than the parts.\n6. There are a *lot* of photographers on these races. Mostly in the parks. They do charge you quite a heavy fee for the photos - $200+ if you want all of them.\n7. The staff and support on these races is unmatched. I could not imagine how much work goes into setting these races up (barricades, transportation, logistics, food/drinks, stages, cleanup crew, announcers, etc). The volunteers and staff had to wake up butt-crack early to stand out in the cold and rain for hours on end, being cheerful and supportive to thousands of random strangers running by without going insane. There were marching bands, choirs, drum lines, cheerleaders, and some other performers that spent all day out there. And there were announcers and DJs thinking of something to say for 7 hours straight. I am in-awe of their endurance. It is greatly appreciated and adds to an unforgettable experience."

        "Texto": "Hi folks,\n\nI've been running for about three weeks now, and after just three or four runs, I noticed my shins were feeling fatigued/hurt. I thought it was normal (didn’t realize shin splints were a thing) and just pushed through. But yesterday (Tuesday), I had the worst pain yet and decided it was time to really look into it. Turns out, I was probably heel-striking the entire time.\n\nAfter reading some of your experiences and what’s worked for most people, I came up with this routine for myself. I’d really appreciate your feedback or hearing about your own experiences:\n\n\n\n**Everyday**:\n\nAnterior Tibialis Stretch (3x 25 seconds each).\n\nCalf Stretch (3x 25 seconds each).\n\nAnkle rotation (2x30 seconds each).\n\nHamstring Stretch (2 x 25 seconds each).\n\n\n\n**Every other day**:\n\nTibial raises (4 series).\n\nWeighed calf raises (4 series).\n\n\n\nToday (Wednesday), I already started with the stretches and plan to stick to this routine indefinitely. My goal is to ease back into running on Sunday with proper form (if everything feels good by then).\n\nPS: I know seeing a PT or physio is the best way to handle this, but where I live, it would cost hundreds of euros and quite the trip. So for now, I’m doing the best I can on my own.\n\n---\n\nEDIT 1 (Jan 9th - Two days since last run): Since I got so many helpful replies and experiences here, I'll implement what seems reasonable and update you with my progress. Might be useful for someone else in the future. Here are the first things I decided to add/do:\n\n1. Buy a new pair of shoes fitted for me.\n2. Decided to wait a little more before starting the strengthening exercises. Already doing stretches every day. \n3. I decided to add to my list an exercise where you walk on a rug on your heels with knees bent for the 30s, for when I do start the strengthening exercises.\n4. I'm looking into massage techniques. Once I feel I understand them well enough, I plan on adding that too. ",

        "Texto": "# Race Information\n\n* **Name:** California International Marathon (CIM) 2024\n* **Date:** December 8th, 2024\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Folsom/Sacramento, CA\n* **Website:** [https://runsra.org/california-international-marathon/](https://runsra.org/california-international-marathon/)\n* **Time:** 3:18:xx\n\n# Goals\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A|BQ (3:25:00. I cried when the time was lowered by 5 minutes)|*Yes*|\n|B|BQ with a buffer!|*Yes*|\n|C|Have fun|*Yes*|\n\n# Training\n\nI (F30) started my running journey with a 5k in November 2019, and have been consistently running at the 15-35 MPW range since (on and off). Signed up for CIM at the end of April 2024. I had just finished running the Big Sur 21-miler with a time of 2:51:xx. and was convinced that a BQ was within reach if I trained more. All runs except long runs were in the evening after work. Never did more than 10 miles outside of long runs due to work/time/life/motivational restrictions.\n\nI divided my training into two blocks. The 1st block was from May through September, I increased my weekly mileage up to 40-45 miles per week (4-5 runs). Here I focused on Z2 work, base miles, and a long run of between 16-19 miles. This first 18 week training block coincided with my friends’ Berlin Marathon training block - which made the training go fairly smoothly because there were a number of us suffering together. In July I ran the SF Half Marathon (City Half) which was unfortunately 0.5 miles short. My time for the shortened course was 1:33:xx, which convinced me that I was in good shape (considering that a sub 1:40 half was one of my goals for this year).\n\nFast forward to October - December - the 2nd raining block. This was a lonelier period of raining, everyone already ran their race for the year. My mileage during this time was around 48-55 depending on the week. No run was shorter than 6 miles, and I introduced speedwork. This may sound like “bro-science” but my training rationale was just to get used to running at desired marathon pace (and not anything faster!). I deliberately did not train at 5k or 10k effort paces (<= 7:10 min/mile) because I did not believe these are working the same muscle groups needed for longer sustained efforts (and did not want to risk injury). A sample week would look like:\n\n1. Long run - 1.5 mile warm up, MP (\\~7:45 - 8:10 min/mile, starting from 10 miles and built eventually to 18 miles), 1.5 mile cool down. If not MP, ran at autopilot pace (9:00-9:30)\n2. Recovery run\n3. Tempo run (8:00 - 8:30) about 6-8 miles.\n4. 5x800m or 4-5x1000m slightly faster than MP, or at MP. 2-3 miles at sustained MP.\n5. Base miles\n6. Optional recovery run/stationary bike\n\nNo strength work at all oops. Unless you count 30 lunges / week strength work.\n\n# Gear\n\n1. Nathan Quick Start hydration pack - CLUTCH. Used for all long runs and race day.\n2. Saucony Triumph 21 as the primary daily driver, used for ½ of speedwork.\n3. Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 for 90% of the long runs and ½ of speedwork.\n4. New Balance SC Elite 4 (race day shoes) were used twice in the entire training cycle - for a tempo then an interval session. I don’t like wearing race day shoes because they take the magic away from race day (usually will end up 15-20 seconds faster per mile in them). I had worn them for the Big Sur 21 miler in April 2024, and I knew I would be fine in them.\n5. Asics Novablast 4 - regretted buying this, causes major blisters. Backup long run shoe.\n\n# Pre-Race Nutrition\n\nI’m not a big eater, so throughout race week I stretched my stomach by consuming slightly more food each day. Tried to eat 10g carb/kg body weight (500-510 g) on the Friday and Saturday before the race. Carbs were mostly in the form of Costco bagels and white rice, with an average of 3 bagels/day. When I got to Sacramento, I ate out. Panda Express is a godsend for value for money carbs and protein, and this local Chinese dumpling/noodle restaurant called Dumpling House. I swore I paid $13.50 for about 2-3 lb of noodles. Drank 1 bottle of powerade over two days. ½  serving of rice for dinner the night before. **I never want to see a Costco bagel ever again.**\n\n# Race\n\nGot up at 2:30AM (went to bed at 8PM), and took 1 hr to get ready. Ate a coffee and 2 bagel breakfast, then left the hotel to walk to the shuttle pick up location at 3:40PM. Got on the shuttle at 4:00AM, and was at the start line by 5:00AM. I was thankful that the driver let us stay on the bus and out of the cold for as long as we liked. Left the bus at 6:00AM, waited in line for portapotties, holy cow its 6:40AM (!), so I quickly stretched and headed towards the start staging area. Lesson: line up for portapotties at least 1 hr before!\n\nI placed myself with the 3:25 pace group, because I wanted to be conservative about this race, I didn’t want to blow up after 6 months of training. We start running. By the end of 1.5 miles, I was ahead of the 3:25 pacers, and kept cruising along.\n\nMiles 1.5-6 went very smoothly. I was taking a Maurten every 30 minutes, and a SaltStick tablet every 45 minutes. I was shocked at how fast I was going (woo supershoes!) relative to the amount of effort. The sheer number of people on the course, and the frequency of cheer stations made it feel like a race where people were all in this together. This definitely kept my motivation up. I singled out a couple runners who appeared to be going at similar paces and tried to keep up with them.\n\nMiles 7-15 had the rolling hills that the course is famous for. Do not underestimate these hills! I slowed down a little bit on uphills, but they aren’t steep and never last for more than 30 seconds. I made sure that I didn’t go all out for this portion, and tried to save my energy for later. You can see them coming, so you can adjust accordingly. I would say the downhills are definitely forgiving on the legs. \n\nMiles 16-21. Around mile 16 I started to see the 3:20 pace group. I thought to myself, we’re doing so good! I managed to catch up with them around mile 17, and got slightly ahead of them by mile 21. At this point the weather started to get really warm (I have a low tolerance and was wearing long sleeves), and I felt that my energy was pretty much draining away. As we approached Sacramento, all I wanted to see was the J Street Bridge -  where was this bridge?! I needed to know that the light at the end of the tunnel was approaching soon.\n\nMiles 22-24. We crossed the bridge and started to run down street numbers starting from 57? I avoided any signs, I just kept looking for the State Capitol. I had to dig really deep to keep going, everything was hot and uncomfortable and my heart rate finally crept up to 170. One of the people I tried to keep up with since Mile 6 magically got faster and faster and left me behind. My friends were stationed at mile 24, and had a good cheer group going (which was very much appreciated and needed). As I approached, I looked at my watch, and it said something like 3:04:xx - I was in shock. My friends ran out to give me a high-five, and all I could yell out as a response was “I’M GOING TO GO TO BOSTON”. I sped away, extremely self conscious that I was being so loud in public.\n\nMiles 25-26.2. Digging deep again…very deep this time - the cardio capacity was there, but the legs were giving up on me. Once I saw the Mile 26 marker,  I sprinted the last 0.2 miles into the finish line.\n\nChip time: 3:18:xx\n\n# Post-race\n\nGrabbed a free burrito and ate it. I could not find my way out of the finish line festival, and was sort of walking in circles for 30 minutes. Made my way to the Jamba Juice and rewarded myself with a smoothie. Had pho with the friends who came to cheer  and returned home :) I didn’t feel the pain in my legs till the day after. My quads are very tight and going down stairs is still hard.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

I was riding high, thinking I'd had a massive breakthrough, and daydreaming of maybe, with a couple of years of hard work, BQing in 2025ish.\n\nLet's just say I was, in hindsight, pretty ambitious.\n\nThings got off to a good start in 2023, with a PR in the Cherry Blossom Half that March. It was only six seconds, but on a much tougher course. With that in the bank, I set my next goal: Redeeming myself for the hobbly finish to the 2021 Seattle Marathon. I knew that, if my knees just held together, I could sub-4:00 it for sure.\n\nNervous about my knees, I spent summer 2023 doing a practice training block for the marathon, and everything went well. I picked up speed on my shorter runs, held together on my long runs (peaking at 22 miles), and my VO2 max topped 53. When September rolled around and it was time to start the real training block, I was as confident as ever.\n\nDid Icarus say the same thing?\n\nThe real training block is where things fell apart, with my left IT band developing issues around peak mileage. I tried a compression sleeve and KT tape, but by race day, I knew I was cooked. I showed up for the race anyway, and gave myself permission to quit whenever the pain got too bad. It was a tale of four quarters: The first quarter of the race, I felt okay. The second, I started feeling it. The third, I noticeably slowed. And the fourth, well, never happened. I walked off the course at mile 20.6, when I couldn't keep up with the 4:10 pacers and thought to myself, \"I know what hobbling to the finish of a race feels like, and don't need to do it again.\"\n\nThe fun thing was, I quit on the inner loop of Green Lake, meaning I had to walk across the outer loop to call an Uber. Let me tell you: If you've never walked through a pack of runners five miles behind you to DNF a race, it's an experience. Still, I considered getting over my stubbornness a moment of personal growth. When I got home, I took off my race bib, stuck it to my fridge—as opposed to the closet shoebox where all my other bibs and medals live—and vowed vengeance in 2024.\n\n### Training\nMy first run back after last year's DNF was a coffee run at Fleet Feet in Ballard two weeks after the race, and I was reminded how much fun it could be to run with friends instead of being on my own little island. So I started to re-engage with the local community after a couple of years away, and got sucked into things. I ran the St. Patricks Day Dash 5k, PRing by 90 seconds in the process, and then the Cherry Blossom Half (1:37:29, missed my PR by 11 seconds) and celebrated the return of the Top Pot Doughnut Dash 5k (which was the first 5k I ever ran, back in 2011). Then, it was time to get to work.\n\nThis summer was all about bulk. I started showing up for more group runs than ever, including quite a few no-drop WWTBC runs that made me slow way down from my usual pace. Some friends and I even got in the habit of running to those runs—there's nothing like running five miles each way to an easy three-mile run to develop a reputation. In mid-July, I even set a weekly mileage PR, at 51.42, though Strava said my Relative Effort was only 60% of when I'd done 50.9 in a week a year earlier.\n\nAnd yet, my knee. Those two weeks off post-DNF had gotten it back to 95%, but by the summer, it still wasn't any better, and I was once again worried about whether it would hold up. So I took the last week of August off from running, a little reset before Fleet Feet training started. The rest didn't help, which made me wonder if part of the problem was how I sit at my desk, so I made a doctor's appointment and kept moving forward.\n\nFleet Feet training started August 31st, my first time in the program since early 2022, and I resolved to stick with the plan. That lasted only a few days, before I wound up with a scheduling conflict for half the Wednesday workouts, and I quickly moved back to half-improvising. Meanwhile, my doctor gave me a referral to PT, which started in mid-September.\n\nBut first, the Orca Half! A race days before my birthday, where I can see my apartment from the finish line. I roped a group of friends into running it as well—I called us 🐳 Team Six—and as race day approached, I had no real game plan. Push for a PR on a fairly generous course? Take it easy and not aggravate my knee? I still hadn't decided when I arrived at the start line on race day, so I figured I'd run the first chunk of the race (including the one hill) by feel, decide around mile four instead. When decision time came, I was at 7:37/mile, and while I thought I might be able to push and get to a PR, I felt it wasn't worth it. In the end, I finished at 1:39:05—almost two minutes shy of a PR, but good enough for third in my age group, my first ever award.\n\nFrom then, it was time to lock in. Do my PT three times a week, make as many workouts as possible, hit the hard runs hard and take the easy runs easy, at least by my standards. \"Race pace\" workouts created cognitive dissonance in my brain, the gap between my half-marathon pace (7:30ish/mile) and my marathon goal (9:00/mile) confusing me. Every time, I erred on the hard side.\n\nStill, I had a lot of worries. The longest run of the training program was only 18 miles, and given both of my previous marathons were sunk past that point, doubts reigned. I felt under-trained relative to past races, but considering the overtraining injuries both times, maybe that was a good thing? Or was it? My left knee felt better from all the PT, but my hip and hamstring were barking now, too.\n\nThe two weeks before the race, my friends all kept assuring me I had it in the bag, but the more they said that, the less confident I felt. My girlfriend and I had a long conversation one night about all of my doubts, and I told her that I was worried I'd seriously injure myself on this one. She reminded me that I didn't have to run this race, but I felt like after over a year focused on this, I was pot-committed. Either I'd take this race down, or it would take me down.\n\n### Pre-Race\nIt's a mile walk from my apartment to the start line, so I woke up at 5am, downed a protein bar and a glass of water, and put on all the gear I'd laid out the night before. As I was getting ready to leave the apartment at 6am, I felt zipper on my shorts' cell phone pocket start to break, so I quickly changed into a fresh pair. Was this the one thing that would go wrong today, or an omen?\n\nAt Seattle Center, I met up with my girlfriend and our friends from the training program, where I once again assert that this is a horrible idea on my part and I'm probably doomed. I hand my girlfriend a bottle of Gatorlyte and a protein bar for post-race, then dashed to the bathroom while our friends went on a warmup jog. On the walk back, I downed half a 5-Hour Energy and a GU Stroopwafel, and the girlfriend walked with me to near the finish line as I shook with anxiety. I passed her my jacket, kissed her goodbye, queued up [my race playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/seattle-marathon-2024/pl.u-JP6KJIKGmeP), and got in the corral.\n\nJust not far enough in.\n\n### Race\n***Miles 1-4***\n\nWhen the race begins, I'm stuck way back in the corral, somewhere between the 5:30 and 6:00 pacers, well behind the 3:50 crew I planned on running with. Part of me wants to take my time catching up with them, but I know I won't feel settled until I find them, so I decide to push it.\n\nAs I cross the start line, I tap my right headphone, and The Killers' \"[Somebody Told Me](https://youtu.be/Y5fBdpreJiU?si=_RRaaRZ-KUAcDIdN)\" kicks in. This playlist is a work of goddamn art, a conceptual piece that struck me like lightning when I was working on my Orca Half playlist months ago. You see, half marathons are easy for me at this point, but marathons feel impossible. So, I decided to not make a marathon playlist, but rather, two half-marathon playlists: Scrapping my rule of \"no repeating artists within a list\", I made sure every artist repeated, in sequence, with no two tracks from the same album. Side A, Side B.\n\nIt sounds easy, but I quickly realized that every time I moved one song, I'd have to move its mirror as well. Things quickly got so complicated that I made a [spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/70cc1qsyqh0aejsl7eeh5/Race-Playlist-Spreadsheet.png?rlkey=430v4xpigfm4zvgvk1utcoje5&st=74pzdt0p&dl=0).\n\nSo, anyway, Brandon Flowers requests that I \"pace yourself for me\" as I blow up my race strategy right from the start, and weave my way through slower runners and monorail pylons on 5th Ave, trying to find the pacers I'm counting on. I spot them about a mile in, but I don't catch up until we're about to turn into the I-5 Express Lanes, roughly 1.5 miles (or three tracks) in. As Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchinson begins speculating about what happens when our \"[Heads Roll Off](https://youtu.be/nBcbDS5AGnk?si=aFVssRcgi7OyXgvk)\", I shift gears and coast into the dark.\n\nA mile or so later, we re-emerge from the tunnel into the early moments of daylight. Just ahead of me, the 3:50 pacers. Just behind, the 3:55 ones? I briefly wonder whether my guys were slow or those guys are fast, but conclude it's out of my control. Besides, I have at least a minute banked from booking it to catch up with my pacers, so I'm really running at more like a 3:49. I'm where I need to be, no longer \"[Burning Down the House](https://youtu.be/_3eC35LoF4U?si=8u03ZXjipstFgDz7)\". Like the song currently resonating in my earholes, this is all a \"[Jigsaw Falling Into Place](https://youtu.be/GoLJJRIWCLU?si=no34D_uVgsxK9F8U)\"\n\nI hit the second aid station around the 3.5-mile mark, and down my first GU (Roctane Sea Salt Chocolate) a minute or two later. My plan for the race is to hit alternating aid stations, for water or Nuun, with GUs at miles 4, 8, 15, 18, and 22, with a Maurten 100 at mile 12, and a mini Japanese KitKat at the spot where I DNFed last year, as a treat.\n\nThis will not last.\n\n***Miles 4-8***\n\nComing off the Express Lanes a little after mile five, I get a little ahead of my pacers, then spot my first friendly face of the course: My girlfriend's ex-husband, who's working the third aid station. (It's fine, we're cool, stop worrying, I said he's a friendly face.) I skip the station, and he's too busy grabbing cups to see me zoom by. A few minutes later, I see another pack of friendly faces: Some of the gals from the Fleet Feet program, who are, by sheer coincidence, cheering for folks across the street from my freshman year dorm at UW. I wave as I go by, and notice my mouth feels dry. I begin to reassess my hydration strategy in real time.\n\nThe course winds through the UW, up and around Drumheller Fountain, as we come down Rainier Vista, I grab both a Nuun and a water from the fourth aid station. I down them both, followed by another GU, and as we go up and over the bridge to the Husky Stadium light rail station, I self-assess.\n\nThis was the spot where I felt the first signs of my knee getting worse last year, as though it was nudging me towards the train: \"Hey, body, we could be home in like ten minutes. You know, if you want to.\"\n\nLast year, the pain jumped to a 4/10 around here, and only got worse. In this moment, my knee, hip, and hamstring are all feeling like 2s. I question whether they can hold on. The Beths remind me that \"[Future Me Hates Me](https://youtu.be/8ogCRFOUoZM?si=9EJ6Oe8Ivp2SRA-b),\" but maybe, just maybe, my leg can [Three Stooges Syndrome](https://youtu.be/gmBj8r1-fDo?si=uTuqt2eCZRoDvdyj) this race.\n\n***Miles 8-14***\n\nThe course continues, across the cut, through the Arboretum, and up into Interlaken. This is where the 3:40 pacers dropped me last year, and this is where the 3:50 pacers get back ahead of me, after I'd (barely) led them the last few miles. As I try not to worry about it, I spot a convenient distraction: A new nemesis.\n\nJust steps of me, I spot a man wearing white arm sleeves and an off-white tank top reading \"Optimistic Runners\" on the back. I am renowned for running in all black, especially so on race day (the only time I run in all-black Goodrs), and my pessimism is legendary.\n\nI do not know this man. I do not wish him ill. But now, only moments after I've become aware of his existence, I do wish to destroy him.\n\nThis man does not know I exist, and his \"[Sweetness](https://youtu.be/ROatPGGMvXg?si=O6pmkv0c19VaoJjM)\" will not be concerned with me.\n\nOnward, we all continue. I find a trash can, and empty my trash pocket, realizing a moment too late that I've thrown out the wrapper for the piece of gum I'm still chewing. I spent a good half a mile debating what to do about it, but as LCD Soundsystem's \"[All My Friends](https://youtu.be/aygY5OqMuKE?si=bRyjSjHE7tGHPwo5)\" kicks in—the first track of the usual \"epic midsection\" of races, which bumped slightly ahead in the mix to accommodate this playlist's concept—I realize I need to decide so I can take my Maurten. I throw the gum I'm chewing in a planter as I run past, and hope the cops blocking cross streets won't take this as a provocation.\n\nThe University Bridge. The Burke-Gilman. Gasworks. Back onto the Burke. I've gone from planning on hitting alternating aid stations to getting two cups at every single one and still feeling thirsty. My leg keeps getting grumpier, but at an acceptable rate. Then, the playlist flips.\n\n***Miles 14-18***\n\nWhen I said goodbye to my girlfriend pre-race, she said she'd be waiting for me right outside her office, at mile 14. \"Side B,\" she said, having heard me ramble about the playlist more than anyone else.\n\n\"Maybe the tail end of Side A, if all goes right?\" I replied. \"I gave the playlist some slack.\"\n\nIt was true—the playlist was timed for a sub-3:57:41 finish, and I planned on running with the 3:50 crowd. But I'm not as far ahead as I thought I might be when I spot her through my sweat-smudged Goodrs and give her a wave. I'm seconds into Side B, somehow both ahead and behind.\n\nKaren O insists I'm a \"[Zero](https://youtu.be/pmGNo8RL5kM?si=HV1U9TnmXgsKLBNV)\" as I keep moving, and as the course takes a steep uphill towards and onto Aurora, Shirley Manson encourages me to \"[Push It](https://youtu.be/Pmd3UiNfNkA?si=boogCl3_1xEvyOq8)\".\n\nAs we approach 39th and Aurora, I keep an eye out for my friend Gus, who's supposed to be a course marshal at that intersection. A mutual friend has been joking for two weeks now that Gus will tase me when I pass, but I plan on waving to him anyway. Shockingly, when I spot him, I see a man-shaped crumple at his feet, and Gus is on the phone. I wave at Gus, and he yells words of encouragement despite the phone call.\n\n(The next day, at a post-race party, Gus will tell all of us that said crumple was a 23-year-old man running the half marathon who'd had a cardiac arrest. Gus called for help, medics got there quickly, and the man is expected to be fine. Gus is the real hero of this race report.)\n\nAt mile 16, as we reach Green Lake, I pocket my gloves. I'm still with the pacers. The Joy Formidable is singing \"[Cradle](https://youtu.be/W66yhfMb4d0?si=4ev6Kaf1gwRd3Fme)\" to me, and ten miles from freedom, all I want to see is the end of this.\n\n***Miles 18-22***\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this playlist was a real struggle to curate, but one thing that helped it come into focus was the realization that a song by my friends' band, the Smokey Brights, \"[Sad Boy Song #39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c51Z8tLpGB0)\", was begging for that numbered slot in the ultimately 58-track playlist. (Not counting the bonus, filler songs that were there to keep me going if I missed my goal.)\n\nOn the walk to the race this morning, I realized that, if all went well, this song would be hitting right around a) the moment when I'll have run farther than I did this whole training block, which also happens to be b) the point where I've historically fallen apart. I made a mental note to check in with myself when it came on, and here it is. I'm doing okay, I think?\n\nI'm still double-fisting at each aid station. The pacers pull ahead of me at each one, about ten seconds in front, but then I close the gap, and then rinse and repeat. If I were an optimist, I'd say I can see the \"[Other Side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3PbFlfurME)\", but, well, we already discussed that like ten miles ago. That guy's still here.\n\nAround mile twenty, one of the four(!) pacers—the two from the first half just kept on going with us, even as their supposed replacements kept over—strikes up a conversation with another runner out of nowhere. I want to scream at them—SOME OF US ARE IN ZONE 4 HERE!—but keep it together. As I pass last years DNF spot, I gulp down the mini KitKat (a suggestion from a friend who said he always likes to have a treat during the home stretch of a race), and get an encouraging text from my girlfriend that I swipe away on my watch. She's trying to be supportive, making sure I know where I'm at. I'm already keenly aware.\n\nAnd so, we finish the second loop of Green Lake, and swing back onto Aurora. On the uphill, the pacers start to get ahead of me, and I lose sight of my nemesis, too, and I wonder if this hill will be \"[The Only Heartbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmXFF_whkVk)\".\n\n***Miles 22-26.2***\n\nI'm definitely losing steam. My left leg issues are starting to ratchet up, my right knee is feeling funky, my biceps—where my long-sleeved shirt is bunching since I pulled it above my elbows forever ago—are going numb, and my mouth definitely doesn't taste like it's supposed to. But I'm still moving. Less fast than before, but still reasonably fast. And there's time on the clock.\n\nI take my last GU (not counting the spare) just after mile 22, and power forward as best I can. At the Aurora Bridge, I finally give in, and walk for a bit, keeping an eye on my watch and swearing I'll get back into a run once my heart rate drops below 140. It gets there, and then when I reach the next street light—no, the next one; okay, the one after that—I return to a run. When the last aid station comes into view, I slow to a walk again, down two Nuuns and a water, and check my watch. I have half an hour to go two miles. I'm feeling sick, but not *that* sick.\n\nI've got this! *I've got this?!*\n\n\"[I Know the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ9-xN6dCW4)\", but I'm \"[Losing My Edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjDMdSwefk)\", and the kids are coming up from behind. One more brief walk, just for a few seconds, and then back into gear.\n\nDown Aurora. Hang a right. Another, and there's the 26 marker, and \"This is nothing like it was in my room, in my best clothes...\"\n\nI start feeling so overwhelmed I worry I'm not going to make it the last 0.2. I remember my mentor the first time I did the Fleet Feet program, who puked twice between mile 13 and the finish line of a half, and missed her goal time by something like five seconds, and wonder what fate awaits me at this last left turn and \"I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope...\" and a gentle curve and a turf field and the announcer saying my name and those clocks say 3:52:XX and \"I won't fuck us over, I'm [Mr. November](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxWQMyoYJBU)\" and I'm across the line, still breathing, still upright.\n\n### Post-race\nI tap both earbuds, stopping mid-song and deeply mid-daze. A race medal finds its way in my hands and around my neck, and I stumble through the finisher area—thoroughly inundated with non-participants—in search of a space blanket, two bottles of water, and some snacks. I find the first two, at least. And then, the portapotties. At the start of the race, I was sure I'd have to pee at some point, but once the race began, I felt like any pit stop might make everything lock up, like it did three years ago. I wasn't going to risk it.\n\nWhen I emerge from the portapotty, I'm swarmed by eight or so friends, all seeking fist-bumps and offering congratulations, and one of whom accuses me of sandbagging expectations the last few weeks. But by the time the bumps are all exchanged, they can tell I'm not right, and ask what I need. I say my girlfriend has my Gatorlyte—except I use her name—and she appears seconds later, and we walk off together to find somewhere I can sit or lie down or whatever. I'm pretty sure this is how about half of those folks learned we're dating.\n\nWe find a spot in the first row of Memorial Stadium's bleachers, sit down, and I manage a few sips of Gatorlyte before I bend over and start to break down from some combination of pain and emotion and relief for somewhere between five minutes and the five years that it feels like this race took off my life. Once I've returned to being mildly functional, she tells me I came in at 3:51:07, and we walk—well, she walks and I hobble—off towards the monorail that'll get me within crawling distance of home.\n\nOnce I'm back in my apartment, I rip last year's race bib off the fridge in a moment of celebration, and soon after, life slowly returns to my body. The girlfriend makes me cinnamon rolls from scratch, and I thank her profusely for everything, especially the shoes from the future that I ran the race in, which she snagged for me. When I mention I finished the race to the tune of \"Mr. November\", she asks me to play it, since she loves that song, and then I play her the playlist's next and final track: Los Campesinos' \"[Avocado, Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-M_m1I1uKU)\", the cacophonous banger I always put at the end of my race playlists, the song that marks my goal time, the song I didn't even make it to today.\n\nThe next night, we go to happy hour, then we walk—well, she walks, and I limp—three blocks to the Medal Monday celebration our training group put on. She's wearing her Chicago medal, and I'm wearing my Orca Half and Seattle Marathon ones, and a few more people pick up on the fact that there's something going on here.\n\nAt some point in the night, I suggest we make a sacred pledge between us: No marathons in 2025. (In this moment, I forget I've already entered the Chicago lottery.) She's already made such a vow with a close friend, but allows me to join the pact.\n\nI've got a few races on the calendar for next year, but for the first time in five years, I have no real running goals. It's time to have some fun with this whole thing again.\n\nOh, and get that tattoo I just earned. But that might be a different post, another time.\n\n*Made with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.*"

Last year, my first attempt at a marathon told a story of arrogance, of overconfidence, leading to a humbling downfall. I had completed many physical challenges before the marathon; Land's End to John O'Groats, the Singapore Duathlon, half-marathons, trail runs, the sub-20 minute 5k; the list goes on. All of which I completed on a wing and a prayer; no research, no real training plan, just get out there and do it. I thought the marathon would be just the same. I foolishly thought of myself as some kind of \"athlete\". Alas, the marathon proved to be an adversary like no other I had faced before. But it was exactly the wall I needed to hit, the slap in the face to bring me back to reality and realise just how much there still is to learn.\n\nThis time, I wanted to tell a story of redemption, perseverence and growth. And what better place to tell that story than amidst the ancient temple of Borobudur, the rich, vibrant culture of Central Java and the stunning landscapes of Magelang, forever in the shadow of the imposing Mount Merapi.\n\nBut in order to tell that story, I would have to close pay attention to every lesson that my first marathon taught me:\n\n1. The real race starts at 32km. Doesn't matter how great you feel before that, all of that was just the warm up.\n\n2. It's not always enough to trust your feelings and instincts when pacing. Feelings can be fleeting and fickle. Sometimes, you just need numbers.\n\n3. Train the EXACT nutrition strategy you plan to use on the race. Everything down to the brand and flavour of the energy gels. You need to take on more water and fuel than you think, so you need to train your stomach to handle this.\n\n4. I learnt to quicken my cadence so I wasn't overstriding and heel-striking. This significantly lessened the impact on my joints.\n\n5. Equipment actually does make a difference. Sounds obvious, I know, but to me, it wasn't. I had always taken a vain kind of pride in beating athletes who had spent a lot on fancy equipment, while I was using any old crap. The marathon beat that mentality out of me. When my feet started cramping up at km 32 and my toenails fell off, I finally understood why people put so much consideration into their choice of running shoes. This time, after months of testing and deliberation, I treated myself to some Adidas Adizero Boston 12s, and they made a huge difference.\n\n6. Zone 2 training. Not every training session has to result in me gasping for breath, red in the face, sweating buckets. Overall distance, and experience going over the 30km mark, is the most important thing in training.\n\nThe Training\n\nAfter so many years of training like a free bird, following my whims, going on instincts and feelings, it was hard to adjust to a more regimented plan. And after all my years of training, I have never had a major injury, so I was hesitant to give up this approach and put my fate in the hands of someone else's plan. I managed to strike a compromise with myself though; I didn't strictly follow any one plan, but I looked at numerous available plans, saw what they had in common, and structured my training with those fundamental principles in mind. It still allowed me to listen to my body and not feel like I was stuck in a grind, but also ensured that I was training effectively with researched, proven methods.\n\nA typical week consisted of:\n1 or 2 hill training/fartlekking sessions\n1 strength training session\n1 long run\n1 or 2 easy zone 2 recovery runs\nOther sports including swimming, football and pilates\n\nMy main focus was on getting more experience past that dreaded 30km mark, so I gradually increased the length of my Sunday morning long runs. My peak week was 65km, and my longest training run was 32km, which I completed in 2:53. Easily on track to smash my sub 4 goal, but the intimidating presence of that final 10k was always looming over my shoulder, filling me with doubt.\n\nFinally understanding the basics of training did wonders for my performance. This year, I set PBs in every race category leading up to the marathon:\n5k in 18:51\n10k in 42:36\nHalf marathon in 1:40:07\nNot bad for 35 years old! Wish I'd known sooner!\n\nPRE-RACE\n\nI hate the taper. It always makes me feel anxious and guilty for not running and eating so many carbs. I always feel like I could have done more in my training, and the temptation to go out for one more long run past 30k was very strong. But I told myself to trust in the process, which was devised from the trial and error of so many before me.\n\nJust as I was getting ready to leave for Jogja, the fire alarm in our building went off and my wife and I had to walk down 32 flights of stairs. So much for keeping my legs fresh.\n\nAnd to make things better, we both caught colds 2 days before the race. Headaches, sneezing, sore throats, the lot.\n\nAnd to make things even better, we got stuck in traffic for several hours after the race pack collection with no food or water, leaving me feeling a little dehydrated.\n\nBut I told myself, I don't need things to be perfect. The hard work is already done. All those 4am starts when I just wanted to lie in. All those training sessions before work that I fit in even though I had so many other responsibilities to attend to. The battle was already won there. I did all that when I was tired, stressed and pressed for time. This race is just a celebration of all that I've done. I've already proven to myself that I can do this in suboptimal conditions.\n\nNevertheless, I told myself that if I was still feeling very ill from the cold, I wouldn't run. As much as I wanted to press on anyway, it wouldn't be fair to the other runners if I infected them, and it wouldn't be fair to my wife to risk my health like that. I laid my head down at 10pm, 3 hours before I was due to wake up for the race. My head was throbbing, my nose was congested and I was full of doubt and uncertainty.\n\nAt 1 am, my alarm went off. I don't know what on earth my body did in that 3 hours, but somehow, I felt... okay. My headache was gone. My nose was only slightly congested. I didn't even feel particularly tired. There was a slight heavy feeling in my chest, which was quite concerning, as I have asthma and I tend to be very susceptible to chest infections. But somehow it felt right to go ahead. At the very least, I felt confident that I was beyond the infectious stage, as there was no coughing or sneezing, so that was good enough for me.\n\nThe anticipation in the air at the race village was palpable. It was surpisingly quiet as the other runners went through their own rituals and warmups. I kissed my wife goodbye, my ever patient wife who had put up with me devoting my free time to this for so many months, who woke up with me at 1 am to accompany me, and who would now wait 4 hours alone just to cheer and support me for that last stretch. I promised not to keep her waiting, and promised to myself to always show as much dedication and patience as she has.\n\nI was right at the front of the corale, just behind the pacers and the elites. It was awe inspiring to be almost shoulder to shoulder with those athletes whose careers I had followed. Rikki Marthin, the Indonesian legend. Geoffrey Birgen, the king of SEA marathons. Borobudur glowed in the twilight as the national anthem soared, and it dawned on me that this would be a defining moment in my life.\n\nThe Race\n\n0-10km\nSo many people sprinted past me at the start. It felt satisfying to watch them go; either they were true elites who had devoted their lives to this, or they were overconfident, adrenaline fuelled newbies who had no idea what that final 10k feels like. Just like me 1 year ago. I made a mental note of a few of them, just curious about which category they would fall into and if I would pass them later.\n\nAs soon as I started running, I felt absolutely fantastic. The taper and carb/electrolyte loading had done wonders. I had almost forgotten what it felt like to run with fresh legs. It felt like they were just carrying me automatically, like I wasn't even powering them. In the dead of night, with the rhythmical pounding of 2150 footsteps, not a whisper of voices, and streetlights shining into my eyes, the whole thing felt like a dream. Surreal.\n\nI fell into a comfortable pace just behind the Sub-4 pacers. It was a massive group, and I was a little surprised that such a large proportion of the runners would go for that goal in such a notoriously difficult course, known for its high humidity, temperature and steep hills. Someone pulled up beside me and asked if this group was sub-4, and I noticed that he was already drenched in sweat and breathing hard. I said yes, and watched as he charged ahead to the front of the group. I wanted to tell him to relax, to hold back, but decided that was none of my business. Either he is made of tougher stuff than me, or he will learn the same lessons that I did. I couldn't stand in the way of either of those outcomes.\n\nI read some wonderful advice on this very sub to dedicate each 10km to someone important to you who helped you make it to the starting line. Spend every meter of that 10k thinking about everything they did to help you. I fully intended to do that, but as the faint traces of sunlight began to emerge from behind the distant mountains, bathing the rice paddies and villages in a golden glow, I found there was nothing in my mind except the beauty of my surroundings. \n\nAs the sun continued to rise, the villagers began to emerge from their humble abodes, lining the sides of the roads, grinning at us and shouting encouragement with such genuine enthusiasm. At times, training can be a lonely endeavor for me. I have friends who run, but it's difficult to find anyone with the same pace and distance as me, so most of it is done alone. To be surrounded by so many sharing the same struggle, the same dream as me, supported and encouraged by onlookers, was simply magical.\n\n10-20k\nThe sub 4 group was steadily thinning out. I passed the guy who had asked me earlier if this was the sub 4 group, who was jogging now at barely a walking pace. That was the last time I saw him.\n\nThe hills started picking up now. I had trained a lot for this, albeit only on a treadmill, and had developed quite an effective strategy. I would keep my head down, looking at my feet, not focusing on how long or steep the hill was. I would shorten my stride length and keep the same cadence. That's it. Don't worry about your pace, just keep the same cadence, and it's over before you know it. Every hill, we lost more runners from our group.\n\nThe humidity was 95%, and the effects were very noticeable. Sweat didn't eveporate, it just poured off you. Luckily, I did almost all of my training in Jakarta, so I was quite accustomed to it, but I could see that it was affecting runners who looked fitter and stronger than me. As I passed them, I felt a hint of doubt. Was I pushing too fast of a pace? No, I still felt great somehow, and even felt like I was holding back a lot. That's good. I reminded myself that the first 30km should feel a little too easy.\n\nNow that the sun was fully up, the locals of Magelang came out in full force, and my WORD do they know how to put on a show! The pounding of drums, the haunting beauty of gamelan music, the costumes, the dances, the chants! Groups of school children would perform their routines which they had clearly been practicing for a long time, but with so much passion and enthusiasm. Dancers and actors would perform tirelessly in the heat. And if you gave anyone a high 5, they would lose their minds screaming! Their energy felt euphoric. They truly did their country proud, showing off their rich and fascinating culture. And bare in mind, many of these people were humble rice paddy workers, breaking their backs day in and day out to feed the nation, yet they were doing all of this just for us?! Just a bunch of runners of no real consequence? They brought many a tear to my eye and charged me with so much energy. I come from England, where there is an inherent cynicism to most things. And don't get me wrong, I love a bit of cynicism, but there's something about how the Indonesians give so much sincere enthusiasm to the simplest of things that's made me fall in love with this country.\n\n20-30k\nI made a friend here. As the sub-4 group ran past a particularly passionate crowd of supprters, we both remarked to each other how inspiring their performance was. We got chatting, and I was surprised to hear how calm my voice was. I didn't sound tired, even though my legs were just starting to feel the faintest hint of fatigue. We talked about our families, our running experiences, our love of Indonesian culture, our training, the route. The kilometers just melted away. He was Indonesian himself, and he told me that whenever he runs with a bule (their word for a Western foreigner), he always gets a personal best. I said I would happily be his good luck charm, and promised that we would finish together.\n\nThe rolling hills continued and the temperature steadily rose. At this point, I felt the first shadow of a creeping doubt in my mind. There's still so far to go. You're already starting to feel tired. This was a mistake. You're out of your depth. There's no way you can keep this up. But then I remembered how I felt at this point in my first marathon. At km 21, I felt tired. At km 23, I started slowing down. At km 25, I was exhausted, and barely managing a jog. At km 32, I began walking and the cramps started. Comparatively, at km 25 this time, I was in much better shape. When I really paid attention to my body rather than the anticipation of how much further there was to go, I realised that I was actually fine. I brought my attention back to the present and brushed those destructive thoughts away.\n\nI have to give huge credit to the pacers here. Their pacing was absolutely immaculate, and they adjusted it for the hills. They shouted encouragement whenever we had a difficult section. And their playlist was absolute fire. It takes tremendous skill and mental fortitude to be a pacer of that calibre in such adverse conditions, and I tip my hat to them. \n\nMy friend told me that he started right at the back of the corale and had to run hard at the start to catch up to the sub 4 group. At first, he had found it easy, but now he said he had to really push himself to keep up with them. I told him not to force it. That he has to run his own race and save enough energy for the last 10k. He said no, he would not give in. I nodded in silent approval and we pressed on. \n\nNow the hills became relentless. Our group was down to only a handful now, and I could see that some were visibly struggling. I began to feel the first hint of the EXACT same cramp I had in the first marathon. It starts in my left foot and calf. When my foot strikes the ground, it makes my toes involuntarily curl up and my calf locks into place in intense pain. Somehow, I figured out a technique to alleviate this. As soon as I feel it starting, I turn my left foot out to the side and run like a penguin for a few steps. No idea how it works, and it looks stupid, but it works. \n\nWe approached the biggest hill of the course. I later learnt that it was called \"bukit cinta\", which means \"love hill\", but it spared us no love. The pacers roared out in defiance, I put my head down and retreated into my own world. Shorten your stride, maintain your cadence. I kept repeating it to myself. My body had been quietly whimpering in the depths of my thoughts, but now it began protesting in earnest. Shorten your stride, maintain your cadence. If you stop now, you won't start again. I heard pained, frantic breathing behind me. I resisted the urge to look around. This is my battle and mine alone right now. The breathing behind me grew more distant. I felt my thighs burning. Finally, it began to feel a little easier, and I realised the ground was beginning to plataeu. I risked a glance behind me, and saw that the source of that ragged breath was my friend. My friend who was in agony and who could not keep up. My friend who I had pledged to finish together with. I wish I had asked his name. I broke my pledge and continued on.\n\nKm 30-40\nAfter love hill, I somehow managed to recover quickly. I had been taking on much more water and fuel than I did in my first marathon - 2 cups of water/iso at every station and 1 gel every 30 mins. It worked wonders, and luckily I had no nausea or digestive issues. I thanked myself for taking this aspect of the race into account in my training.\n\nAt km 30, something strange happened. I didn't decide this, I didn't know why it was happening, but I found myself making my way to the front of the sub-4 group, which was now down to around 10 members. Using my somewhat limited Indonesian, I introduced myself to the pacers, thanked them, told them they were great, and bid them farewell. I ran ahead of them, all on my own. When the pacers realised what was happening, they shouted out in joy. \"GO MISTER! AYO AYO!\". I had been holding back my pace this whole time, and now I felt the urge to let my legs go. So I let them take me. Foolish or not, the feeling of freedom and independence was uplifting. This was a true celebration of what my body could do.\n\nNot long after I had soared ahead, I was met with another brutal hill. Not as long as the love hill, but steeper. I was hit with a wave of regret for my decision. It was much too early to break away. I said it myself, everything before km 32 is a warmup. What the hell was I doing? Oh well, too late now. Now I needed a new mantra. I thought of my wife, waiting alone in the race village, and I remembered that I had promised her that I would be there before 8:30. \"Don't keep her waiting\" repeated itself endlessly in my head like a broken record.\n\nThat mantra, the music and the high fives from the crowd were the only things powering my body at this time. This is where the real pain begins. I knew it; all this time, I knew it would be hell after 32km. If it wasn't, I would be disappointed that I hadn't given it my all. Every second was an internal battle in my own mind, grappling with thoughts that I could not continue. But I vowed that I would not show a crack in my mental armour. The crowds showered my with love. Tears streamed down my face. The hills continued trying to break me.\n\nKm 40-42\nI heard a shout from behind me. \"Mister! Ayo!\". It was the pacers! How embarrassing! I spread my wings to fly from the nest, and they found me sprawled at the bottom of the tree. Fuelled by embarrassment now, I picked up my pace again. Every few steps I had to do the penguin walk. I looked at my watch. My brain couldn't handle any mental arithmatic right now, but I new that this one was gonna be close. I had nothing left, but I pulled the energy from somewhere to surge forward. An older gentleman matched my pace as we rounded a bend and the magnificent borobudur came into view. I told him \"Bapak... hebat\" and we grabbed each other's hands in a moment of mutual respect. I don't know where it came from, but I began laughing. Everything felt absurd.\n\nThe red carpet and the finishing arch finally revealed themselves to me. I wanted to sprint to the finish, but my broken body would not let me. I heard a sound. The most heavenly, soul-mending aria of an angel. \"HONEY! HONEY!\". To anyone else, it was a shrill, desperate screech from a crazy lady, but to me, the screams from my wife were the most beautiful sound I have ever heard. With everything I had left, I powered over the finish line.\n\nPost Race\n\nI was completely overwhelmed, both physically and emotionally. I barely paid attention as I was given my medal and a banana. I even walked stright past the finisher jerseys without picking mine up. There was only one thing I needed. As I rounded the corner from the finishing stations and was greeted by my beaming wife, I rewarded her for her patience and undying support with a sweaty, stinking, blubbery hug, hands sticky from energy gels, face crusted with salt. Lucky woman, eh?\n\nWe sat down by an ice bath, but the ice had already melted and the water was warm. I didn't care. I was in shock. To be obsessed with a goal for a whole year, to be so filled with doubt that you could ever do it, and then to actualy do it. It was... odd. It didn't quite sink in immediately. My body felt like it desperately needed something, but I didn't know what. I didn't want to eat, didn't want to sleep, didn't want to drink, didn't want to move.\n\nLater that night, we celebrated with some traditional Jogja gudeg and bakpia. Jogja food is famed for it's sweetness, but nothing can possibly taste sweeter than the serenity of meeting an impossible goal like this. Ok, that was a bit cheesy, I admit. Let me have it though. I think I've earnt a bit of cheesiness, just this once.\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nEven though my time was not particularly impressive, I was surprised to see that I just about made the top 100 out of 2150 runners! A testament to how challenging the course was. \n\nI had told myself that once I met my goal of sub-4, that would be the last marathon I ever do. There were times when the commitment felt like such a burden, and I questioned why I was even doing it. But a few days after the event, now that I've had time to process everything, it's hard to fathom going back to non-marathon life. In the course of training for and completing a marathon, you will experience every single emotion on the human scale. Fear, doubt, regret, despair. Hope, confidence, arrogance, triumph, love. It's all there. You live a whole lifetime in one race. It brings everyone together regardless of their backgrounds; we all share the same goal, the same struggles, we all empathise with each other.\n\nEvery run tells a story. This time, I told a story of redemption, perseverence and growth, but there are many more stories to tell. Your stories on this sub have given me invaluable advice and inspiration, and I will be hanging on every word. Thank you. And thank you if you read mine. I wasn't intending for it to turn into a novel, but here we are. Let's see what story I have for you next year. Until then."

        "Texto": "\nSo shoes like FitFlops that create frontal plane instability in order to get you to recruit lower limb muscles while you walk used to be pretty popular and kinda still are. There’s been a study that concluded that there was no significant effect from them: \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23017840/\n\nAnd this might be purely anecdotal/coincidental/placebo effect but when I do a mild jog in them, I can definitely feel it in my calves and ankles vs when I use my trainers. Does anyone know if there’s any long term effects I should be wary of? \n\nAnd are there any running shoes that replicate something similar? I know that rockers and MBT and the like create instability as well in order to propel you forwards during a run. But as far as I know, you have to be running to reap the benefits of the rockers and if you use them for everyday walks and all, it can cause issues. On the other hand, FitFlops can be used for everyday walks. \n\nIs it only the low drop shoes that come close or do they work differently as well?"

I was actively discouraged by my parents from any physical activity because they thought it was a distraction from academic pursuits. As I learned more about health, I realised that I needed to make changes – for me this mostly revolved around better eating habits as my study and work made it difficult for me to commit to sports and I hated running due to bad experiences at school (dead last in every annual  compulsory school cross country run).\n\nThe geek in me became curious in the Nike+iPod Sport Kit in the late 2000s as a way for me to passively log steps/jogging and eventually I decided to sign up for a half marathon for the “achievement”. Achievement unlocked, completing this in an incredible 1:51 hours (goal was to complete the course before it closed off behind me).\n\nA decade later, I realised that I had not pushed on with the positive habit, and fell back into a sedentary job and life. Keen to avoid health complications, I signed up for the same half-marathon event in my city and again surpassed all expectations (thanks Coach Bennett and Coach Cory!) to complete this in a faster time of 1:48. I started to get into more running events and decided to do the Queenstown half-marathon. However I fell in love with the full marathon course and decided to change “never” to “maybe” and eventually signed up for the full distance.\n\n \n\n**Training**\n\nI looked online at the wealth of available training programmes. Many coaches were willing to guide me – at a cost – and I decided I was prepared to pay. However the hard sell was really getting to me, especially the evangelical followers from some coaching programmes. A kind coach reached out to me and told me I seemed to possess enough knowledge and intelligence to do it myself. While I did not end up compiling my own training programme, I felt that the Nike Run Club base knowledge that I had acquired from Coach Bennett, combined with common sense, would allow me to tackle Pfitzinger 18/55 as a first-time marathon runner (previous Redditors had done the same successfully as long as they were sensible).\n\nIt's true what they say that the work of the marathon is in the training. The reason I had said “never” in the past for doing a marathon was the time involved as a slower runner. Long runs on Sunday took up to 4 hours out of my busy schedule, and I ended up spending much of Sunday afternoons eating, drinking, toileting, eating, drinking and toileting on constant repeat.\n\nFurthermore, I had started to do Intermittent Fasting aka Time Restricted Eating in the period before my marathon training started 18 weeks out. I had intended to stop this if needed but found a way to continue this. I’m not sure that this was the smartest idea in the world nutrition-wise, but I now have an unbroken streak of 16+ hour fasts for the past 183 days and going strong – including marathon race day.\n\nThe hardest part of the training was ironically not the training itself. It was actually fitting in the training around my life. In the end, it was like picking up another part-time job. It threw my life upside down but because I had committed to the training and the race, I had to find a way. Not being a morning person, I suddenly had to change my body clock for morning runs to ensure that I could get my training runs in before work because I found it too hard to do runs while tired and hungry. Eventually I hit a period where some Sunday mornings I would need to be ready for work by 8 am. Getting up to start runs at 3 am was completely out of my comfort zone, but I had made a commitment that I needed to uphold. I switched from Apple to a Garmin watch last year and I paid close attention to hydration and sleep in order to support and sustain this intense training programme (and never once became sick, due to looking after myself so well).\n\nI had to overcome many mental barriers as already outlined. Another one was running in the rain. I HATE running in the rain. “But what if rains on race day?” Of course I would run if it rains on race day!\n\nObviously it’s logistically challenging to plan 4-hour training runs around days of the week, work, and weather. I got wet – including getting drenched on some 20-mile runs. I learned how to clean and dry running shoes.\n\nCoach Bennett and everyone knows that training never goes perfectly to plan – and that’s ok. Somehow I managed to get through 18 weeks of Pftiz “perfectly” – every run was completed as I had no injury (I made sure all easy runs were done easy, with a chest strap HRM to help guide me) and no illness (I put this down to ensuring I had plenty of sleep and I tried to increase my intake of healthier foods).\n\n \n\n**Pre-race**\n\nPerfection ground to a hard stop on the eve of the race. I was scheduled to fly into Queenstown at 5 pm, allowing me a few hours to settle down and early to bed for a 4 am breakfast for the 8:20 am start. We were delayed and went to touch down just after 6 pm.\n\nWe had been warned about heavy winds in Queenstown. What I was not aware of was that this was enough for our landing to be aborted. After what felt like 5 minutes or more, the pilot informed us that they were “not confident” to try to land again, so we were heading back to Wellington (a 10-hour drive away after a 4-hour ferry ride).\n\nI was getting set to hold a pity party for myself but moments later my thoughts instead went out to the many on board who, like me, had been training for months and who had just had their dreams crushed. What made my situation any more special than theirs?\n\n“Find a way” is a recurring theme when it comes to marathons, training and preparations. I was fast running out of options as our flight was due to return to its origin at 7:23 pm and there were precious remaining flights connecting Wellington to the South Island of New Zealand where the race was taking place.\n\nMy outside hopes of making the 7:45 pm flight to Dunedin (a 4-hour drive from Queenstown) became a reality when I discovered upon landing that this flight had been delayed. I reached out to random strangers who had been on the same flight and found 3 marathoners (2 first-timers like me) who were prepared to take a gamble on me and I managed to get them onto the same flight.\n\nMy father delivered a car to Dunedin airport and we commenced our impromptu road trip, getting to know each other for the first time as we had not been seated together on the flight. Driving safely and within the road speed limits, the time passed in a flash and very soon we arrived in Queenstown at 1:30 am. I gave myself a precious extra 15 minutes of sleep and got up at 4:15 am to fuel and prepare for what was to come.\n\n \n\n**Race**\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked my Garmin in the pre-race zone. It said 9% and “no sleep detected” from that morning. I felt exhausted but not tired. I had worked for months for this and was one of the lucky few from the aborted flights to have made it this far. I told myself that I could not waste this chance and would dedicate the run to all those unable to make the starting line.\n\nI listened to all the helpful pre-race advice from everyone here. I started slow, pulling myself back if my pace crept up. I drank at every aid station (except the one with a full table of empty cups……). I got into a good rhythm and felt strong.\n\nI have never felt cramp before, so was surprised when I started to feel minor cramping at 12 miles. \"Mind over matter,\" I told myself. Don't waste your mental capacity thinking about it.\n\nThe running coach who had helped me along the way said \"run a series of 5km\" rather than 42km. \"A series of 5km bites is far easier to mentally handle than 42km in one gulp\". At 15 miles, and feeling strong, I decided to dial up my effort very slightly. My average pace of 9:22 min/mi made sub-4 a realistic possibility with my splits starting to pick up speed. At 18 miles I was still feeling strong with plenty in the tank, and I passed a lot of runners who had stopped due to cramp. Unfortunately at around 20 miles, my legs also started to seize up.\n\n“A marathon is a 20-mile jog with a 12-mile run at the end,” they said. I had a 20-mile jog with a 12-mile \\*limp\\* at the end. I had to push through a lot of pain to keep going. I knew I had to hydrate but also knew I could not stop – every time I slowed down at the aid stations to get electrolytes, I could feel my legs cramping up badly.\n\nBy 21 miles I knew that I could not get sub-4, so told myself just to keep putting one foot in front of the other. I quickly did the math in my head and even though I had slowed down to 11:15 min/mi, I would still be able to get under 4:15 hrs – that was the goal time all the way back before I had started training and would still be a huge achievement given the events leading up to my arrival to Queenstown.\n\nThe final 3 miles were the worst. Not only because of the obvious, but because there was little to no atmosphere on this section of course. I have seen others post about this too. While there were supporters along this section, most were quietly waiting for their loved ones to cheer on. This section knocked the wind out of my sails and it was mentally brutal as my left ankle also decided to cramp up. Mile by painful mile I struggled through the final section at a progressively slower pace. I could hear music and cheering ahead of me in the distance, and desperately powered forward yearning to once again receive encouragement from random strangers.\n\nAs I arrived at the playground on Queenstown Beach, I looked around to see families and children engrossed in their own activities. I would need to push on further for the support I was so desperately seeking. Road cones were set up on the esplanade, and as I looked up I saw crowds holding up support signs and making noise. That noise gradually built up as I progressed, and very soon I felt no pain in the legs. I have gone from last in every school cross country to researching running online and watching two Olympic marathon races this year.\n\nThis felt like running at the Paris Games and I threw my arms up in the air in celebration, which fuelled the crowd noise even further. Garmin says that my final 0.5 miles was completed in 9:01 min/mi.\n\n \n\n**Post-race**\n\nAt the finish line, I picked up my phone from the bag collection and quickly logged in to see how my new marathon friends Louise, Doug and Elaine were doing. \"No Timing Data\", each reported. What had happened? Had they slept in? Had the travel overwhelmed them? I was reluctant to reach out to them in case they were feeling any shame in having made the epic journey to Queenstown only to DNS. This kept gnawing away at me and eventually I plucked up the courage to TXT Louise in the late afternoon with “What happened with your crew today? Are you all ok?”\n\nLouise quickly fired back a reply saying that they had all finished and were at the Speights Ale House – just around the corner from where I happened to be! Within seconds we were reunited in each other's arms. Afterwards, Louise messaged to say \"Meisha our friend was almost in tears seeing you with us in the restaurant\", later adding \"Can't believe we all did it considering the circumstances.\"\n\nAt the end of the weekend, I transited through Wellington and looked for Lucy from Air NZ who had helped secure us all on the last-minute flight to Dunedin. She wasn't working but I told our story to her colleagues and they sent her a photo of the finisher's medal. Lucy was thrilled to hear the ending of the story, and hopefully, this story inspires some of you in the same way that other runners’ stories have inspired me.\n\nWhy did I restart running? It wasn't to race or achieve any PBs. It was purely for physical and mental health/well-being. While I still haven't fallen in love with running, I cannot deny that I have never regretted having gone for a run – even those \"bad runs\". As Nike Coach Cory says – we end each run as a more elite version of ourselves. Remember that you are only in a race with yourself. Embrace the supportive running community and be kind to each other. Help each other along the way as we never know whether one day we ourselves will need to rely upon a fellow runner to get us to our next starting line.\n\nI do believe I have been changed for the better. And because I knew you, I have been changed for good."

I've been following the Jack Daniels alien plan for a while now and really been enjoying it. Last year around this time I was in pretty good shape and was feeling good about the possibility of doing my first half marathon sometime in 2024. I missed out on the Gasparilla half but registered very early for the half at the St. Pete Run Fest. I just had to finish my race calendar for the spring and I could concentrate on getting through the death that is the Florida summer, make it to the cooler weather (hopefully) and send it.\n\nIn March of this year, I had back-to-back race weekends with my local city 5k and then the Strawberry Classic 15k challenge (10k then 5k) to round out my race calendar. The weather was getting hot already, but I had my sights set on a 5k and 10k PR. Disaster struck during my pre-race week. I was on an easy run with my dog when I tripped over a heave in a sidewalk, fracturing my clavicle down near the shoulder joint and having some pretty bad road rash on my right arm and back. I was shut down for minimum of 4 weeks, right arm in a sling, unable to drive or run, and it hurt to ride a bike or walk fast. It would be 7 weeks before I could get back out there again. I did (slowly) walk the city 5k with my dad, finishing last in my age group and having a very sore shoulder the next day.\n\nIn May I started to rebuild a base, doing easy runs on the treadmill and some stuff on the road. The summer was in full swing, and I had to recalibrate my paces since everything felt too fast. Heart rates were high, I was doing run/walk to let it get back down, and with the heat and humidity I was so tired I was skipping my usual Sunday long runs. I also lowered all my training maxes for my weightlifting (5/3/1 going 3 times per week) and started that back up too, knowing I would need to rebuild the muscles that I lost. My dad said his rule of thumb was you need 2 weeks back for every week you were out.\n\nWhen June started I rolled in the speed work -- tempo runs, intervals, stuff like that. I wasn't back to the old paces yet, but I was getting there. Still no long runs because Sunday was my only day to \"sleep in\" at this point and I was just so tired. July, August, September just felt like a slog. I did a lot of treadmill runs during the week because it was easier to schedule them around my work day and doing school runs for my two boys who attend different schools. Plus, it kept me out of the summer sun. Long runs were back in the plan starting in late July (10k to start with). I noticed with my long runs that I was having issues with the muscles in my upper back and biceps, and with the area of my shoulder where the fracture was, so I made a point to include lat pulldowns, rows, and shoulder shrugs to what I was already doing for shoulder rehab. I needed to strengthen those muscles so they wouldn't be a problem for the duration of the half.\n\nBy the time August rolled around, I was firmly in the \"I'm so back\" mode, back at my training paces from March even though I might not be stretching out the workouts like I was back then (20 minute temp run in August vs 2x 15 min in February, for example). It was just so bloody hot and humid. I was starting to freak out internally because I hadn't done very well with marathon pace workouts, finding them very difficult to maintain the pace for more than 5 or 10 minutes during my prescribed sessions. I knew I needed one weekend in either September or October with low humidity and temperatures below 85 degrees to get a real read on how I was doing. I knew that I was going to feel like a million bucks after that first cool front of the season, and that kept me going.\n\nAnd then came the hurricanes. We lost power for 4 days as a result of Hurricane Helene, but our house didn't flood like so many others did. No power meant no treadmill, so I tried my best to get up early to go run but it was difficult. I did get a long run in that week though. For Hurricane Milton we were right in the crosshairs, so we packed up and evacuated, heading off to Alabama (the same place we evacuated for Irma in 2017). Pinellas county got hit hard -- thankfully the Tampa Bay area missed most of the storm surge that was being predicted after what happened with Helene -- and our house was without power for a total of 9 days due to damage to our house. While we were in Alabama, I did get two runs in but didn't get any once we returned home.\n\nAt the end of October, I did a 12.1 mile long run that felt pretty good given the weather, followed by 60 minutes at goal pace the next weekend that boosted my confidence. Pre-race week went by without any incidents this time and I was ready to go!\n\n### Pre-race\nI was invited to a hockey game by a friend, the problem was the race was the next day. I knew I wouldn't sleep well anyway with all the race excitement, so I agreed on the condition that I was the designated driver and that he had to buy my dinner. I didn't know the seats were on the club level, so I ate a bunch of really good food to fuel up. The chicken al pastor tacos were really good, I ate 6 of them over the course of the game. The Lightning shut out the Devils and a good time was had by all. I drove everyone home, showered, and was ready for bed around midnight for a 5am rise.\n\nI'd spent most of the week watching the weather closely, and it looked like race morning would be a cooler temperature but warm up fast once the sun got higher. The race started at 7am which was just after sunrise. I spent some time here and there on Saturday to set out my outfit, packed up a check bag with a change of clothes, got the gels (CarbBoom banana-peach flavor) set out, all that. I packed my hydration vest with a soft flask and a running belt and figured I would decide the morning of what I was going to use. I pre-mixed some Liquid IV to sip on and packed a water bottle, pushing the decision on what to carry with me to the morning.\n\nThe plan for race morning was to get up, have a bagel with honey, and try to poop before I left at 5:30. That plan was mostly executed. I got about 2 hours of sleep total, which was even less than I had thought I would. I also changed my mind on the bagel and packed a few of the sweet potato cookies from the *Run Fast, Eat Slow* recipe, planning on eating them in the car while I drove. They got accidentally left behind, but at least I did get to poop before I left. Parking was busy so I picked a parking garage a little further away and had a nice walk to the starting area. Had a bonus poop in the porta-johns, put my race shoes on (Saucony Endorphin Pro II's) and I was ready to go. I decided to go with the hydration vest with my 450mL soft flask full of plain water. I would alternate water and Gatorade for the 8 total hydration stations and could hit up my soft flask when needed. I also stuffed my running hat into the back mesh pocket and packed 3 of my 4 gels into the pockets. I ate the 4th one at the starting corral.\n\n### Race\nThe temperature was nice in the starting area, and because the buildings along the route would block the sun for most of the first half of the course I decided that I would go after it for that time in an effort to bank some time for the later part of the course that I knew would be very sunny and warmer. I saw someone running with a challenge bib and he said that the temperature started out nice but it warmed up quick for the 10k. I expected the same for the half as well. If the weather was going to be hot and muggy from the off, I was prepared to throw time goals out the window and treat it like a long run, just trying to finish and celebrate completing my first half. I thought I at least had a shot at the sub 2 and was ready to fight for it.\n\nThe starting corral had signs up for various paces, I lined up between the 9:00 and 10:00 min/mile signs. The 2:15 pacer was in front of me and I could see the 2:00 pacer further ahead. I didn't want to fight through the crowd much further so I just hung out where I was, knowing I could pass people once we got onto the wider avenues. I was warmed up with some strides and dynamic stretches and was ready to go.\n\n*Miles 1-3*\n\nThe start is nice and wide open once the crowd was through the starting arch, but there was a bottle-neck at the first turn to head south. That's part of the course where there is return traffic that will come the other way. My pace dipped here as things clogged up a bit, but I was already past the 2:15 pacer and had my sights on the 2:00 group. I hung with them for about a quarter mile as we headed south on 4th street, but tried to settle into my target pace of 8:30/mi and left them behind. I locked on to a couple of people ahead of me that were around the same pace and managed to stick with them for quite a while. No headphones to start with, trying to enjoy the energy from the group. There was a small bridge over a creek around the 2.5 mile mark that bumped my heart rate up, but it came back down pretty fast. I was hanging around the 150bpm mark and feeling strong. There were still some debris piles out in front of houses along this part of the route. My heart goes out to those folks and what they are going through -- Helene really was a huge blow to the area.\n\n*Miles 4-8*\n\nMiles 4-8 were running east/west in downtown. The buildings were blocking the sun and there was a slight breeze every now and then. Once we turned west I knew there was an uphill section -- uphill by Florida standards -- of about 30 feet of elevation gain over a half mile. It's noticeable in front of you as you turn the corner onto 1st Ave S and I was prepared to slow down a little to keep my heart rate from getting too high. It's some slight ups and downs until you come back towards Bayshore drive along the water around mile 7.5. I ran this part of the course when my wife ran this event 2 years ago so I knew what to expect. Heart rate creeped up toward 160 on some of the inclines but came back down on the descents. We did run by the now roofless Tropicana Field (Home of the Rays!), which makes me sad every time I see it. Lots of support on the course in this area from crowds of people and local businesses. There were people handing out beer, jello shots, somebody had a big table with a bunch of candies on it and gels. Alternating water and Gatorade at the hydration stops was working out well, and I was able to hit my soft flask when I felt I needed it. I took a gel around miles 4 and 7.5. It was nice to see all the new buildings that are going up in downtown and I tried to force myself to look around instead of focusing right in front of me.\n\n*Miles 8-10*\n\nThis is where things started to get tough, where the course goes out onto Bayshore Drive and is an out-and-back loop. I was able to see the leaders coming the other way with their police escort and was cheering them on as best I could. The problem was that my right ankle and left hip were starting to get pretty sore. Except for a short brick section, the roads were sloped toward the bay. Not crowned, actually sloped. I had to keep my pace up for as long as I could and was still doing well, but desperate for the road to level out. The temperature wasn't that bad yet. I think this section was where they had the pickle station. I love pickles and was excited at the prospect of having a little salty snack. Instead, it was very salty and strong brine that got up my nose (I kept running) and made me gag. Look, for some people that probably was welcome, but not for me. I hit up my water that I was carrying with me to try and rinse that out of my mouth and grabbed one of the used gel packets from my pocket to try and squeeze any bit of flavor out of it that I could. There's a small bridge over the water leading to Snell Isle that I powered my way up. The mark for mile 10 is just before the turnaround to head back toward the finish.\n\n*Miles 11-13.1*\n\nThe sun was coming out stronger at this point and I was starting to feel it. Unless I suddenly had a catastrophic ankle or hip failure, though, 2 hours was pretty much in the bag. I had enough cushion built up that the last 3 miles just required a 10 min/mile pace to close it out. That was a nice confidence boost as I came over the Snell Isle bridge again. There was a brass band set up at the big turnaround but they weren't playing as I ran by. Disappointing. A few more debris piles out in front of houses too, more reminders of Helene. After the turnaround, I took a very short walk break to switch from my sweatband to my running hat that I had stashed in the back of my vest. Sure, I applied sunscreen to the Friar Tuck on the top of my head but the sun was coming on stronger and it was time to get some coverage. Back over the bridge and back onto the sloped roads. Right ankle still hurting and I think it was affecting my gait because the arch on my right foot was hurting now too. Keep it going! I have no idea where the 2 hour pace group is and I can't even tell you if I passed them on the way back or not. At this point, I was concentrating on the road in front of me, but I did hit every \"tap here for a boost\" sign I saw in these final miles.\n\nKnowing I had some time in my pocket, I walked through the last two hydration stations, grabbing Gatorade and making sure I drank all of it. I had seen the mile 12 sign on the way out and had finally arrived, just the final turns around the Vinoy and then the final push! I didn't want to make a leisurely finish so I picked it up. My right ankle and left hip were screaming at me, the muscles on the insides of my knees were sore, but I still had a pulse and was moving. Nothing was going to stop me now, even if I didn't have the energy to sprint! Coming in to the last small turn before the finish chute I pressed as hard as I could. The finish clock was reading 1:57 as I approached, and across the line! It probably looked like a guy with stiff legs trying to learn to sprint for the first time, but I had done it!\n\n### Post-race\nI had to keep walking. I just had to keep moving. Even if it was in circles around the volunteer handing out medals while I wanted for him to hand me one. Someone was handing out cold, wet towels and I wrapped it around my neck. Just had to keep moving. I walked around a little bit, a quick off to the side to stretch out my quads, hammies and calves, and drinking some water. I got in line for the PR bell (first time is always a PR, right?) and gave it a good hearty ring. I found a bench off to the side to take off my shoes and socks, take off the race bib, all that stuff. I didn't have a dry spot on me, I was dripping off my hat and shirt and shorts. A quick change in a porta-john later and I was at least in dry clothes and crocs for the ride home. I walked around a little bit more to keep the ol' legs moving before heading back to the parking garage I parked in, cheering people on for the last half mile of the route as I went.\n\nOverall, I was super happy with the execution of the race plan I put together. I know I left some time out there once the temperature started to warm up, but it was a good feeling to know that I had the time in the bank, and that I have a chance to improve my time if the weather is better. Those sloped roads on Bayshore, though. What a killer. I had a nice breakfast at home with my wife on the patio, did some stretches, and took stock of my body. I have a small bruise on the tip of my \"index toe\" of my left foot, but the toe nails are fine. My right ankle and left hip were very painful for 3 days but that's finally doing better after a lot of stretching and some walks. The arches of my feet, however, are still mad at me, but they are improving. I **definitely** need to find some additional ways to strengthen my ankles before I attempt that course again.\n\n*What's next?*\n\nA couple more days of easy stuff before I pick the plan back up and keep building. I have a charity 5k the first weekend of December and the Tampa Hot Chocolate 15k the weekend after. I feel like I can PR both if the weather is good. I'm also signing up for the Gasparilla half, but who knows what the weather will be like for that one. At least I've run that part of Bayshore (in Tampa this time) many times before. Maybe the St. Pete Beach 10k (they aren't doing the half anymore). \n\nThank you for reading!\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

Initially I went through C25K, then did some 10k races and at the end of last year I started racing half marathons. I had two under my belt (Como, which I also posted on this sub, and Madrid) before starting my training for the Athens Marathon.\n\nWhy Athens? Well, that's honestly very simple. It's where the term \"marathon\" originated, so I thought there was no better way to have my first one right there. The race actually starting from Marathon and arriving to Athens was a very focal point in my decision. Yes, I knew about the strong climbs (for a marathon) on the course and I tried to train accordingly to those, but as you can imagine from the title, it didn't go as planned.\n\n# Training\n\nMy training plan was pretty simple: 18 weeks, with 4 days of running, 2 of strength training and 3 rest days. I'd basically have my strength training the days I had my easy runs (running in the morning and going to the gym in the evening), plus one tempo/interval session and a long run. In addition, to prepare for the uphills, I planned some uphills sprints at the end of one of my weekly easy runs.\n\nThe first weeks were going pretty well, I managed to hit every single run and the fitness level was definitely increasing. Then the summer holidays.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was a fantastic 3 weeks trip which still involved a lot of trekking, but of course I basically didn't run. I accounted for that in my plan since I knew it was going to happen, and when I returned I came back to my usual training. Still, some good unexpected weeks since my fitness level didn't decrease much. Of course I adjusted and reduced a bit the mileage on my first week back, but evertyhing was still going smoothly. Unfortunately I wasn't as constant as I was before, I missed some days, and I definitely had one day where I pushed too much on the track (I was doing 400s sprints). Next day, a sharp pain on my left foot totally stopped me, I managed just to barely came back home.\n\nTurns out, it was a mild tendinitis, but I didn't know at the time, so I basically stayed at total rest for a week, before going to a physio. He told me to do some exercises and to stop with running to make it heal... wrong advice. I wasn't so sure of his advice, so I went to another one and he made me realize I shouldn't have totally halted running. I re-started with some super easy run-walks, and I also noticed my shoes were giving me issues: another problem I didn't notice before, but anti-pronation shoes were actually making it worse. So I stopped using them in favor of a neutral shoe, and it was like night and day. That compared to my new training plan for recovery mitigated the tendinitis issue, which was then totally gone.\n\nThe only problem was... it was basically marathon time, and the max amount of KPW I ran in the last month and a half was 28k. I knew it was too little, considering I didn't even touch 30k KPW for a while. My physio gave me the same advice to not run it. But I was feeling too good, even with my low mileage. You know how it goes.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI arrived in Athens two days prior to the race, just to have a full day to visit some parts of the city, having a nice walk and go to the Expo. Pretty cool stuff.\n\nThe day of the race, I had a very good breakfast with some boiled eggs, coffee, a protein bar, a croissant, an orange juice, some biscuits and a banana. Then went to take of the many buses directed to Marathon.\n\nA pretty windy morning, but didn't faze me too much. Had a lot of water before starting from the Marathon stadium, which was packed of runners but still handled great. Had my start from the 7th block around 9.20.\n\n# Race\n\nThe first 10k are basically flat, so they were a good test for my race form. I honestly expected much worse, still I kept a slower pace since I knew the tough parts were gonna rock me and my low mileage. I really enjoyed this first part, even if there weren't so many people around, but the energy was still great!\n\nThe plan was to take a gel every 5k or so, and I sticked to that, while grabbing also a water bottle every 5k. \n\nAfter that, there were some others 1-2k with flat roads, before the first uphill started. I dropped my pace a bit, which was planned, but I was still feeling very good. No tendinitis, no problems in any of my legs, no cramps, it was honestly so much better than what I expected. I sticked to my pace, until the first big uphills started around the 15k mark. That was definitely tougher, I walked for some seconds on one of them cause my BPM were going nuts, but I kept going without any particular issue.\n\nAnd then I felt some discomfort in my rectus femoris. Oh no. I knew it was exactly that muscle cause I strained it during the Madrid Half Marathon months prior, and it seemed like the same exact feeling. It got worse the more I went on, and I honestly knew at that point that I'd retire.\n\nI mentally checked out there, not because of the pain which I think was still manageable, but because of fear of what was gonna happen after. Yes I ran through it for the last 6k in Madrid, but here there were 24k left! More than a half marathon of total discomfort and pain, plus a distance which I never ran.\n\nI tried run-walking, stopped at some of the many aid station to put on some kind of gel, but of course it didn't do much. Honestly at that point it was miserable, and I stopped just after the 20k mark, saying I was gonna retire.\n\n# Post-race\n\nOn the pick-up bus to go the finish line, I was of course sad that I didn't finish, especially because I still had a lot of energy left and the leg wasn't hurting so much. But I knew that I made the right decision for myself. I honestly prefer to better train for it another time and finish how I really want, instead of crawling to Athens. \n\nIt was still a great experience, but for the moment I'll go and focus on trail running, which was my designated objective for 2025.\n\nI learned a lot from all of this. Don't underestimate your training. Don't be too cocky just because you finished an half marathon in under 2 hours. There's nothing wrong wih retiring, I think it's actually a harder decision to take when you're in a race of this magnitude. \n\nLesson learnt, looking after my next adventure!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

        "Texto": "TLDR: Running, for me, is a positive feedback loop. The more I run, the more I want to run. This seemingly simple idea took me six years to realize.\n\nI never was an athletic kid. I was the nerdy kid who was picked last to join the gym team, the one who would beg the librarian to let them read inside instead of roving the playground. I always felt clumsy and awkward in my body, especially when puberty rolled around with a vengeance. I hated exercise, because I found it painful, sweaty, and uncomfortable, and I didn’t understand how anyone else *could* enjoy it.\n\nIn college, I first started to exercise out of a sense of dreary obligation to improve my health, paired with a feeling of inadequacy I felt when comparing myself to my athletic girlfriend, who was president of our university cycling and triathlon clubs. I googled the bare-minimum exercise guidelines––120 minutes of weekly cardio, and some strength training. Like a reluctant student, I half-tried to put these guidelines into practice. On good weeks, I grudgingly jogged a few times each week, with each run never longer than thirty minutes, plus doing a few weightlifting sets in my college gym. On bad weeks, I would exercise barely or not at all, then blame myself for what I perceived then as my laziness and lack of discipline (as opposed to understandable antipathy towards an activity I actively disliked). On my jogs, I’d alternate between uncomfortable running and self-hating walking, disliking it the entire time, my brain stuck on a loop: *I hate this. I should slow down to a walk. How many more minutes until it’s over?*\n\nMy attitude first shifted a little when I studied abroad in New Zealand. On weekends my friends and I would pile into my shitty, beloved rust bucket Saab and drive four hours across the island to embark on some of the country’s “Great Walks”–– long, varied hikes with stunning scenery straight out of a Lord of the Rings movie. My lifelong love of nature birthed a love of hiking. I craved the awe I felt surrounded by snowy mountaintops or deep fjords, and the sense of accomplishment and wellbeing and comradery that came with a long day’s hike. But I always thought of my hikes as adventure, not exercise. I certainly didn’t connect my New Zealand outings to the tedious weekly jogs I endured at home. So when I got back to the states, I returned to my awful, bare-minimum weekly runs. The next year, COVID hit, and my world shrank even further. I’d run-walk masked in bleak circles around my local park like a rat in a cage, never seeming to get any faster, never spontaneous enough to try a different route.\n\nWhen I was twenty-three, my father committed suicide, and my relationship to running began to change. Running became a form of therapy, a way to press down and experience my inner hurt. I felt numb a lot of the time, but when I ran hard, I felt something in between pain and pleasure. At least I felt *something*. The angrier or sadder or more frustrated I felt, the harder I ran. I ran hardest when I felt nothing at all. Sometimes my grief would literally chase me into my shoes and out the door. But though the way I felt about running had begun to change, I kept to my old routine––rarely more than thirty minutes, at most four times a week.\n\nWhen I turned 26, my girlfriend and I moved across the country, and I began running on the beach path near our house. I don’t know what catalyzed the change that came then. Maybe it was the beauty of the ocean shoreline, the bracing sea air, distant mountains that reminded me of New Zealand. Maybe it was the happy tourist families on the beach, the young rollerblading couples, the bare-chested firefighters at the volleyball nets, the neon sunsets. Maybe it was just a natural evolution that had been sleeping inside of me for a long while, preparing to awaken. But one day, a half hour run became an hourlong one. The next day, I ran for an hour again. These longer runs soon became my new default.\n\nOn these runs, the strangest thing happened. I’d spend the first fifteen minutes in my usual discomfort, sinking into my pace. Then, after forty minutes or so, I started to notice a change. I began to enjoy the way my body was feeling –– my legs moving easily and automatically, my breath regular and working, my head buzzing. The running became easier, less uncomfortable, more like a pleasurable mystery I wanted to chase down, a state I wanted to enter. At the end of my run, I’d want to run longer. \n\nOver the course of the past few months, I’ve slowly built up to twenty-mile weeks. My fitness has improved––now I can string together thirty or forty uninterrupted minutes of running, when before I could only manage a few minutes of fast jogging before I surrendered to a walk.  Last week, I ran my first ten-miler, meeting my girlfriend for oversized breakfast burritos at the farmer’s market after. It was slow––it took me two hours. But I saw a pack of dolphins. And the entire time, I enjoyed myself. During my long weekend runs, I listen to my favorite podcasts and let my thoughts wander. My hourlong weekday runs help me detach from the work I’ve done and ease into my evening. Even on the bad days, when I don’t enjoy my runs, or they stir up difficult feelings inside of me, I almost always feel better after––calmer, more steady, more “me”.\n\nNext week, I’ll run my first half marathon. I’ve even started weekly yoga. I am running less than many on this subreddit, but I am running more than I ever have before. I am slow, but I am faster than I’ve ever been.\n\nI did not ever know that running could make me happy. I never knew I could fall for a hobby I once detested.\n\nBut looking back now from the outside, it seems so simple. Few beginner pianists enjoy plunking out boring scales or struggling to sight read. New writers don’t enjoy struggling through the basics of plot mechanics or detangling simple grammar. Amateur chefs rarely savor their first few months of oversalting everything and burning basic dishes. To enjoy any hobby often requires a period of disliking it, and not being good at it. But instead of realizing that I might enjoy longer runs, I spent six years in the “suck” zone––plateauing at a level of activity where I could tell myself I’d achieved the bare minimum, without actually improving my aerobic fitness or pushing past my initial discomfort to arrive at a place where I could find joy in growing fitter and in the simple movement of my body.\n\nIt took me six years to realize something simple, so simple that I know others have written about it. For me, running is a positive feedback loop. The more I run, the more I want to run. And more than that, it’s a positive feedback loop with a threshold gate––I personally didn’t enjoy running at all, until I started running for longer than forty-five minutes at a stretch. Your mileage may vary. We are all different. But I hope you can (safely, sensibly, and slowly) push past the suck. Try dipping your toe in deeper waters. You may find an ocean awaits."

        "Texto": "I know the rule for running shoes is generally ~500 miles, is there a similar rule for age? I usually run through the mileage before considering age but I have had a pair of Brooks Glycerin 20s for ~2.5 years and only 180 miles on them. I have been running into Achilles injuries recently, so I am wondering if even though the mileage isn’t too much if the age of the shoes might be leading to those injuries."

        "Texto": "I’m interested in getting spikes for the upcoming winter season but I’m just not sure on which option would be best for me. I’ll be running on a mix of light packed snow and ice on pavement, and a couple inches of fresh snow on both unmaintained trails (both paved and unpaved underneath, if it matters). \n\nIt seems Kahtoola is the most recommended, but from what I’ve read the microspikes aren’t good on icy pavement and the exospikes aren’t good in snow. I know that nothing will be great in every condition but I’m looking for the best all-rounder. \n\nI’m open to buying separate pairs if what I’m looking for doesn’t exist but would rather avoid it, and I’m not looking to put screws in my shoes right now. Thank you for any input! "

Ran it at 14 months postpartum after having to restart from scratch post C-section and being cleared to run again almost exactly one year ago. This was my first full but I’ve ran 3 half marathons before, first (2:02) pre-pregnancy, second (1:52) at 6mo post partum, and the third (1:39) 4 weeks before NYC as a tune up race. \n\n**Training**\n\nI followed Hanson’s marathon method - joined Luke Humphrey’s run club and used his 55mpw NYC specific plan on Final Surge. The run club is actually really good value for what they call group coaching - no individualised plans, but can ask questions and will get good responses from the coaches, and they do monthly log checks so you can get feedback on how you’re doing. I bought their lifetime membership for \\~$750 during a sale.\n\nThe plan is similar to the classic Advanced Hanson book plan but replaces some of the speed sessions with hill repeats. It alternated between hills workouts and the classic speed days, so you go up the ladder but don’t come down. I ran 54 miles a week on average during the 16 week block, with 4 weeks above 60 miles, highest being 62. Each week consisted of 3 SOS days - speed or hills, goal pace tempo, and long run. 3 easy/recovery days. 1 rest or active recovery day. Ran 830+ miles total during the 16 week segment. Before the segment I ran 45mpw (all easy) for \\~3 months to base build.\n\nThe structure of Hansons worked very well for me. I liked there was never 2 hard days in a row and I could get my easy runs done around an hour and my SOS days around 1.5 hours, with the long run around 2-2.5 hours. This was important because I had to get all my runs done by 7.30-8am, because 1) baby wakes up, 2) sun comes up at 7am and temps go above 90 degrees by 8am. So the 16 mile long run was a great fit for me (and even then entailed a 5am start). There was never a question whether I will finish 26.2 having only ran 16, because we're making a whole trip out of this and I knew I was definitely going to finish.\n\nI didn’t miss a single run. I didn’t perfectly execute every workout, but only had 2 or 3 bad ones and did my best to make up for those as I can. I extended some of the long runs - plan had 3x 16 milers sandwiched by 14 milers, I did 4x 16 milers and extended 1 more to 18 miles. It wasn’t necessary but I was comfortably running my long runs under 3 hours and it was still within their guidance of keeping the distance to 30% of weekly volume so I figured why not.\n\nI ran to a 3:40 goal pace during training, when it’s consistently 86-90+ degrees and 85%+ humidity. I hoped the cooler weather in NYC will translate that to a 3:30 equivalent. 3:30 was the BQ standard for me when I started training hence I set that as my stretch goal. The tune up half that I ran in 1:39 confirmed I should theoretically be able to run a 3:30 full per the equivalency calculators. I went into the race feeling pretty confident.\n\nTaper went from 60 miles on the last peak week, to 50 miles, 45 miles, and 20 miles on race week. I felt great the entire time. The 2 weeks before race week still had SOS days but shorter/easier. \n\nNutrition wise I practiced getting in 60g of carbs per hour on every SOS day. It was rough in the beginning and I had to play around with a lot of different gels, electrolytes etc but I figured it out in the end. \n\nOne thing I neglected was real weight training. I did 3-4 yoga classes every week with at least 1 session being a strength based vinyasa class, and felt a lot better than when I tried to force 1-2 weight sessions. I was injury and niggles free for the entire segment. But I’m not sure if this came back to bite me on race day. \n\n**Pre-race**\n\nThis was tough. I flew in from Singapore, so it was a 18 hour direct flight, with a one year old. Flew in on Thursday and figured will have a few days to recover, but I never recovered or slept a consistent stretch from the time I got on the plane because baby+jetlag=disaster. We picked up our race packet on Thursday, walked around a bit on Friday, and went to Central Park for a shakeout run / to figure out post-race logistics on Saturday. \n\nCarb-loading went well. Followed Featherstone Nutrition's guidelines.  I had to eat 400g for 3 days. Did 2 bagels and a banana (125g+) for breakfast, pasta and udon for lunch and dinner (don’t know exact macros since we were eating out), and drank a Maurten 320 (80g) on top. \n\nNight before the race I slept maybe 3 or 4 hours. Jetlag, plus some incident downstairs at 3am with 3 police cars showing up and the people downstairs having a mental breakdown crying non-stop. I got up at 4am, my Garmin body battery was only 70. My dad drove me to the New Jersey bus spot at 5.30am and I got in the start village just before 7am. My corral opened at 9:45am and I started running at 10.20am. There was no pacers for what I wanted to run in my corral as I initially put a 4hour estimated finish when I registered and my tune up half result was after NYRR’s strict cut off for when you can update your best pace.\n\nIt was a long, COLD wait. I had lots of throwaway layers but was still freezing. I was first in line to see the therapy dogs, which helped a bit. Every race should have therapy dogs! Ate a bagel and a banana on the bus and sipped slowly on a Maurten 320 while I waited. Toilet wait wasn’t too bad, but man the ports potties are a lot more gross than the ones in Asia. \n\n**Race**\n\nI lined up at the front of my corral before they opened, then jogged close to the front of the wave after the corrals opened. I took pace bands for 3:30, 3:35, 3:40 at the expo, wore the 3:30 and 3:40 ones as bookends. First time using them and found them really hard to read as you’re running.\n\nComing from hot to cold weather, running felt A LOT  easier and I went out too fast. Averaged 7:50 for the first 10 miles, mile 2 was sub-7… I was about 1 min faster than the 3:30 pace band by mile 10 and felt really good, then slipped and had a bad fall and lost a lot of momentum. I was about a minute behind the 3:30 pace band by halfway and after the mile 13 bridge my quads started to feel a bit shaky, which made me panic a bit knowing mile 16 and 24 hills were still to come. Never full on cramps, but felt a bit weak if you know what I mean? My right ankle was also a bit iffy after the fall and I made an executive decision then to ease up, and ran to what felt like my long run pace effort. I decided to prioritise making sure I had enough in the tank to finish strong and not bonk or have to walk at the end. I also lost my salt pills somewhere between mile 4 and 8 (had planned to take them every 4 miles) which also made me a bit scared since I’m a heavy sweater. \n\nBrooklyn was the best stretch. I wrote my name on duct tape and had it on my shirt for the first 8 or so miles before it fell off. Hearing folks cheer me on specifically was really empowering and I’m sad I didn’t prepare better by printing my name on my shirt so I could’ve had that the whole way. Crowds were great the entire way but it’s not quite the same without your name. I  did go out too fast on the first half because of this tho.\n\nThe second half was not too bad, since I eased up. My quads were tired but everything else was fine, I focused on just keeping moving and going by effort. I never felt like I hit the wall but mentally I was exhausted - never had to concentrate for so long before! By this point I stopped checking my pace bands and looking at my watch. I focused on when do I get to eat my next gel, when do I have to refill my handheld. Mile 17-20 were the worst I think, once I hit the Bronx I knew it was only a mile in the Bronx then we get to come back down to Central Park and that was the end. It was comforting knowing there was only 6 miles left, since that's the duration of my easy runs and less than an hour. Mile 24 was tough on my legs, but mentally it was easy to just chug along because I knew it was the last big hill. I tried to speed up after the mile 24 climb to get back under 3:40 but it was quite congested with a lot of walkers, and I ended up missing my goal by 1 minute. \n\nI think the hills were definitely something I was unprepared for. I ran hills in training but the longest repeats were 4min and I don’t think I had enough total hill volume throughout the week. My typical week was around 1200-1500ft of elevation gain, and my long runs only 500ft. NYC was 900ft of gain and 950ft of loss. My quads were unprepared, maybe if I did weighted squats it would’ve helped? I definitely went down mile 2 too fast but GPS was wonky under the bridge and I had no idea what I was running. \n\nBiggest lesson for next time - start more conservative. If I didn't fall, or if the last 2 miles were less congested, I'm confident I could have made sub-3:40. But if I had executed better and ran a more even split, maybe I could've had 3:35. 3:30 was probably out of reach all along in NYC tho given the hills. \n\nI ate 9 gels total - took 8 Maurtens (2 caffeinated) with me with plans to eat one every 3 miles, and took an extra SIS gel on course. Ended up eating one every 2 miles after mile 20. Felt great during the race but a bit nauseous afterwards. \n\n**Post-race**\n\nThe walk out of Central Park is horrendous. I tried to sit down for a bit and someone came almost immediately to pull me up! I finished right around 2pm and met my family around 2:30. Phones didn’t work, so decide on a place to meet beforehand. \n\nOne other thing I wished I had done- wear a throwaway pair of shoes to the start. I wore my Endorphin Elites and my feet were in pain by the second half. I’ve worn them on long runs before but never for so long - from 5.30am to 2.30pm! It took me insanely long to walk the post-race stretch because my feet hurt so bad. \n\nI didn't feel hungry and skipped lunch, then had an early steak dinner to celebrate. Overall quite happy with the first marathon experience and can’t wait to do it again in London next year! "

        "Texto": "**Race information**\n\n**What?** Kullamannen Ultra 100 miles\n\n**When?** 1-3 November 2024\n\n**How far?** 159.5km (100 Miles)\n\n**Where?** Southern part of the west coast of Sweden (Högernäs, Mölle, Ängelholm & Båstad)\n\n**Website:** [https://kullamannen.utmb.world/races/ultra-100-miles](https://kullamannen.utmb.world/races/ultra-100-miles)\n\n**Strava activity:** https://www.strava.com/activities/12801037825 & https://www.strava.com/activities/12807679702\n\n**Motivation**\n\nI signed up for the 100 miles Kullamannen last year after the after the Kullamannen 100km trail race. I wanted to challenge myself to a longer distance after finishing with a little something in my legs.\n\nThe southern part of the Swedish west coast is quite flat with the exception of Kullaberg which shoots out of the sea and has a high point of 188m. The course started with two laps of Kullaberg and if you made it passed the 11 hour cut off it was 100km of largely flat running with a variety of surfaces sand, gravel, dirt, bitumen and don't forget rocks. Lots of rocks. To keep things interesting there were two large hills to run/climb up with 20km to go.\n\n**Training**\n\nI had managed to increase my training to 28km / week for the previous 6 months which was a lot better than other years. I had run a marathon and a 26km race but no other real long runs. I was happy with all my gear from the previous ultra so I just went with what I had and ignored all the sales of the flash new gear. \n\n**Race Strategy**\n\nI wasn't going for the podium and my only mission was to get the 100 miles done safely before the 32-hour cut-off time.\n\nThe race started at 18:00, there was an 11 hour cut off to get the 2 laps of Kullaberg done. I would wear trail shoes at the start and switch to comfier runners for the second 80km.\n\nMy nutrition strategy was to eat a gel and a chocolate bar (100cal + 225cal) per hour, keep drinking and ideally have empty water bottles upon arrival at each aid station. At the aid stations grab some sports drink and perhaps some light soup, and try and avoid things that looked like they would take time to digest.\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nThe race was starting at 18:00 on Friday and I was up at 04:00. I have been sleeping poorly for the last month and this sleep deprivation was a concern, if I was just going to make the 32 hour cut off - 46 hours awake while running is a looooong time.\n\nThe Swedish summer had rolled into a warm autumn and it was feeling like almost shorts weather. But the forecast predicted the first near zero night and the wind was blowing the car around on the drive up to Båstad. The race briefing was a nice event, just being out of the wind was fantastic. Also kinda cool seeing some pretty fast runners both local and international.\n\n**Race**\n\nThe knight riding with the lit torch lead the 710 of us out of Högernås. We had been buffered from the wind in the starting area, but now running on the sea path the wind and sea spray were reminding us what we had signed up for. A gentle run up the coast to Mölle to start the first lap of Kullaberg. There were significant queues in the rocky sections of the course and a few brave souls were out there to cheer us on. The ground was mostly dry but the leaf litter hid a few ankle twisting rocks. The glow of the headlamp helped but there were still some jarring twists and stubbed toes. The uphills were tough and some of the downhill sections were just as much work.\n\nFinally arriving back in Mölle about three and a half hours after setting out on Kullaberg. A resupply and then back to it. This time the body was wearier and the supporters had disappeared. The temperature was dropping and the wind was biting with more ferocity. We avoided slowing down too much to make the cut off a non issue and allow some time to take on some food in Mölle we pushed on through the dark and the tiredness.\n\nArriving in Mölle - a bite to eat and a quick warm up by a heater and we were back into the wind and quickly shivering again. We ran over the ridge and eastwards off the point to start the flatter sections. My running buddy started to struggle with food and we slowed down for this section. I wasn't enjoying the chocolate and gel combination much either. It started to get worse for him and I noticed my body feeling the cold and tiredness more at this reduced speed. I was wondering it I was going to need this walking time later on in the race. We separated so that he could run at the pace he needed to hopefully recover. I felt the stress of the cut off nearing and switched into some anxiety running. I was around position 530 at this point.\n\nThe sun rose over the water around Farhult and thousands of birds danced forming constellations then quickly reforming into another shape in moments later. It was memorizing after a night of darkness. My legs seemed to be on autopilot and were passing people whenever possible. Some areas were familiar from the run 2 years ago, coming from the other direction. But some of the kilometers felt like they had turned into miles. The running was fantastic.\n\nFinally arriving in the Råbocka aid station with warm meals and drop bags. I managed to switch shoes to make the impact a little bit less noticeable on the coming flat kilometers. Also a fresh portable charger meant I could charge my phone. My one mess up was mistaking one charging cable for another. I checked my phone and my buddy appeared to be bowing out. I took a little longer hoping I would catch him. I did my best to eat anything that wasn't sugary as I was struggling with anything sugary at this point.\n\nIt really took a bit to get moving again after such a long stop. But then once the legs found their rhythm they kept at it and I took advantage of the flats. My vest became magic and for the rest of the race whenever I needed anything the vest supplied anything at first grab. I still felt the cut off was approaching and I had to use my legs while they felt good. It felt like forever before the next aid station appeared it felt like a weird dream where you were always doing one more thing before it would appear and after doing it you would do another. I filled up my drinks and tried to finally chill a bit with the pace. I was nervous about the big hills but had gained some time on the cut off.\n\nThe next sections had easy little trails, sometimes gravel tracks, some bitumen at times and punctuating all this random rock fields that made holding any pace impossible for me. I tried the make the most of the sun still being up and sped up knowing the sunlight probably wont help much on the hills but it certainly makes running in these areas a lot easier. \n\nAs Hovs Hallar rest stop I tried eating bread with cheese but my mouth felt so dry. I was 3.5 hours under cut off but worried that my lack of energy would push me into a wall and I would struggle to even walk the last 20 km. I tried to have more of the supplied sports drink basically for its uniqueness and so that I definitely had some energy. The first hill was incredible, water streaming over rocks for hundreds of meters and downhill was just as bad. I was wondering how I was going to manage 14km of this before the last flat 6 km in Båstad. I felt the fatigue in my head and couldn't really work out how many caffeinated gels I had consumed. But one more seemed to clear the fog. I was expecting an aid station at the entry to Båstad as there was a cut off there. But I hadn't understood the course guide. So what seemed like an endless march looking for a basic aid station ended up taking me to the final ramp. And there I was able to run up the final ramp for my first 100 mile finish in 250th place or so (from 750 starters). My stress running overtaking lots of people (and I guess a few withdraw ahead of me).\n\n**Post-race**\n\nMy training buddy had just arrived in time to meet me at the finish, I had been expecting to get in hours later. Thank goodness he did as I wasn't up to doing much myself apart from passing out. The tomato stew at the end was heavenly.\n\nLooking at myself, I think my lack of eating would have got to me quite soon. I look a little gaunt today and I am craving salt. Don't worry, I'm still drinking a fair bit of water.\n\n**Questions for the audience!**\n\nWhat are you fueling with to avoid food fatigue? \n\nWhat is the best food you have ever received at an aid stop?\n\n"

Now, I am taking my pre and post-run stretching and prep more seriously. In my journey to be proactive about preparation, I came across these articles about barefoot running and how our feet should/could be ideally structured.\n\nMy arches have/are falling, so I have worn orthotics for several years now, but I'm wondering if I can improve my overall foot health and drop the orthotics. I don't have severe foot problems, but along with my arches, my toes can be uncooperative/inflexible when doing lunges or other activities requiring deep bending in the toes. I always need to give my toes a good tug to make them feel semi-relaxed.\n\nI don't plan to run barefoot, but I am wondering if there are general health benefits to adopting these exercises, including toe splaying, to promote good foot health even when running in \"normal\" running shoes. I don't have a specific desire to run in zero-drop or unsupported shoes, and I run a mix of road and groomed trails.\n\nI tried searching for some thoughts around this, but couldn't find anything really answering the question about barefoot strengthening exercises for non-barefoot runners.

Since then I've run the London Marathon twice, and got super lucky in the NY  ballot earlier this year. My running has slowly been improving with time & patience, and I've been upping the intensity of my training. I knew NY was going to be a huge test and a tough course. For reference, my previous marathon times were: Rome 2017: 4:15, London 2023 - 3:36, London 2024 - 3:23. \n\n**Training**\n\nThe main issue I faced in training (like so many others, I know) is time. Between two young kids and full-time work, it can be so challenging just fitting in the amount of runs needed to keep progressing. For this year's London Marathon, I used Runna which on the whole was really good, but for NY I decided to get a coach (in the loosest sense) who formulated my plans based on the previous week's training and what I could physically fit in each week. \n\n  \nI really enjoyed this approach, and the flexibility and human interaction gave me confidence that I wasn't slipping way off schedule by missing a run here and there. \n\n  \nOn the whole I was averaging 4 runs a week, and I did 5 where at all possible. This generally consisted of 1 easy, 2 tempo/interval & 1 long run each week. Volume wise I was averaging  between 50k - 60k for the most part, maxing out around 75km towards the back end. I know I'll likely need to increase this volume to keep progressing at my age. \n\nThe block on the whole was great, the speed sessions crushed me but sure enough my times were coming down. Health wise I was good besides a hamstring injury which wiped out 3 weeks of tempo sessions in the middle of the block. \n\nHeading into the taper I felt good - my last long run (35k) was at target marathon pace and I did a sub 1:30 HM 2 weeks out. Fitness felt good, legs felt good. \n\n**Pre-race**\n\nA trip to New York is amazing at any time, but to go out there to run the marathon was very surreal. I felt a mixture of excitement/nerves/feel great/feel shit/going to crush this/going to crumble. And everything in between. I would swing from feeling like a sub 3:10 was coming, to doubting whether I was fit enough to run it. The mind games for this one had serious muscles. \n\nMy wife and I headed out to NY on the Thursday. No kids, no work, time to ourselves. Bliss. I sort of put to the back of my mind that I was actually there to run, we just had a great time together. \n\nThe carb loading was a pleasure - all the pizza and bagels I could stomach. \n\nThe day before, my best friend & his wife surprised me while I was having lunch - they'd flown out from London to come and join us. I was so happy, the best trip just got even better.\n\n**Race**\n\nI hadn't fully adjusted from London time, so the 4.30am wake up on race day wasn't actually too bad. I slept well and was ready to go.\n\n  \nI know many people have said what a nightmare the logistics can be in getting over to the start on Staten Island, but luckily this was all plain sailing. I was straight on a ferry with no wait time and then straight on a bus at the other end. The only slight drag was the wait to get into the start corrals - I was in Wave 1 which meant I had about two hours to kill. I know some people had way longer to wait than that, so I couldn't complain too much. \n\nAlthough my A goal was just to PR, I felt I had a really good chance of getting around 3:12. I knew the NY course was going to be tougher than I'd run run before, and I'd studied the various elevation points to try and plan ahead. I'm quite a slow burner usually, and my previous two marathons were both negative splits where I gradually grew stronger as the race developed. Given the increased elevation in the second half of this race, I decided I'd try a slightly more aggressive first half to make the most of the relatively gentle terrain in Brooklyn. \n\nThe uphill start on the Verrazano Bridge worked perfectly for this - I was able to start out super chilled for the first 2K before settling into a quicker pace as we headed into Brooklyn. The first 12 miles absolutely flew by - the crowds were incredible, there were high 5s aplenty and I just kept thinking how cool it was to be running this race. I saw my wife & friends at mile 8 which was the best they got to see of me - I really did feel so comfortable. \n\n  \nI crossed the halfway point in 1:36 - I was happy & my pace felt good and sustainable. Shortly after, around  mile 14, I struggled with one of my gels. As soon as I took it, I could feel a stitch coming on. These were the same gels I'd used in training as well as previous races, so I knew there was no issue with unfamiliarity. \n\n  \nThe stitch faded but I was left with a nagging discomfort down my side. Up next was the Queensboro Bridge as we headed into Manhattan. I knew this was one of the elevated sections to navigate and it came at a bad time, having just had the stitch issue. The first thing you notice about the Queensboro is there are no spectators - you go from a wall of noise to just the sound of shoes on tarmac. This is where the race turned for me - barely a mile previously I was flying and feeling so good about things. But I was beginning to unravel - I went inside my own head and could only think about how hard this was. Also, the elevation is no joke. It may look relatively modest on paper, and others clearly dealt with it better than I did, but to me it seemed unrelenting. \n\nI entered Manhattan and was in the trenches. Every marathon is difficult, they're supposed to be, and the struggle will always hit at some stage. But it came way earlier then I was expecting/hoping. And a lot more intense too. \n\nMy quads were beginning to cramp which was restricting my stride, and I was still having problems taking on gels. Every time I tried, I got a stitch. I decided to ditch them entirely - the choice was try and finish without any more fuel or have to stop/start each time I tried. I chose the best of two crap options. \n\n  \nDespite how bad I was feeling by this point, my pace hadn't dipped too drastically. I was slower than the first half but still managing to hold things together just about. I wasn't enjoying the crowds as much by now, I was totally within myself and just trying to keep one foot in front of the other. \n\n  \nI knew the final big chunk of elevation was to come - and come it did. Mile 23, 5th Avenue. I'm pretty sure this is the final resting place of my soul. It's no exaggeration to say it took everything I had to physically keep running. \n\nIt was at this stage the 3:15 pace group went past me, and I knew sub 3:15 was gone. I did my best to cling on to them in sight, but it was tortuous to see them slowly inch further and further away. \n\n  \nThe final few miles went by in a bit of a blur. I knew by this point that there was no danger of me not finishing, and that offered some relief, but I think I was a bit shell-shocked at what had unfurled over the previous 10 miles. \n\n  \nCentral Park was a sight for sore eyes - but the steady rollers there ensured I'd endure further turmoil right until the end. Never been happier to see a finish line, and have never had to dig as deep as I did in that race. \n\n**Post-race**\n\nAt the finish line, pain gave way to relief. I suddenly felt so pleased that I'd managed to hold on for 3:16. I hadn't felt like that would be possible. \n\nOnce I got away from Central Park I caught up with my wife & friends. The rest of the day & evening was spent just as it should - plenty of beers, laughs, pizza, and bed. \n\nAs of now, I am still unsure whether I had a good day or bad day on Sunday. Was it good that I bagged a PR on a tough course? Or was it alarming how brutal the second half was? I am not sure -  the answer perhaps is somewhere in between. \n\n  \nOverall, this really was the trip of a lifetime. As a Londoner, I love my home town race. But New York tops it for me. I couldn't be more pleased to have completed this marathon, and perhaps one day I will be able to return to face my demons of miles 15 & 23. \n\n  \nLooking forward, I want to keep trying to improve, and I have the Copenhagen marathon coming up in May. Plenty of time to reflect and work out how to approach that one. No bridges, I hear! \n\n  \n"

        "Texto": "If you want a complete backstory of how I started, I made a post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cqf2gu/my\\_first\\_half\\_marathon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cqf2gu/my_first_half_marathon/) \n\nTLDR is that I started running in Late November and couldn't even run a mile continuously, even half a mile was pushing it. Had an infrequent weight lifting background and not overweight, but otherwise very out of shape. My friend who ran in high school made a plan going from 10-25 MPW and I stuck to it very religously. I ran a 2:17 half in May.\n\nA goal: Sub 2 hour: Yes\n\nB goal: Sub 2:05: Yes\n\nMile 1: 8:57\n\nMile 2: 9:08\n\nMile 3: 9:02\n\nMile 4: 9:04\n\nMile 5: 9:09\n\nMile 6: 9:07\n\nMile 7: 9:09\n\nMile 8: 9:10\n\nMile 9: 9:02\n\nMile 10: 9:09\n\nMile 11: 9:10\n\nMile 12: 9:09\n\nMile 13: 8:39\n\nSummer Training: After the race I took two weeks off just doing movement for fun. Even coming back to running after that it felt rough. I ran for fun without a plan until mid June, where I started doing easy miles at 20-25 MPW with one speed and one long run per week. I even hit a couple 30 mile weeks. I was definitely feeling the heat, literally doing slower average paces than when I first started back in December. Audiobooks really helped me at this time. I started listening to the Harry Potter Series only when running, which gave me something to look forward to. I tried for a couple PRs (10k at 1:01 and 5k at 28:30) but otherwise couldn't really push the pace. \n\nFall training: This is when I started increasing my MPW to 30 and peaked at 35 running 5-6 days a week. I also did a lot of cross training biking 1x a week, strength training 2x a week, and badminton 2x a week. My 1x a week speed workouts varied a lot; I did fartleks, intervals, tempos, and other random stuff. One thing with my speed workouts though, whenever I tried to do goal half marathon pace (9:05-9:10 per mile) I felt like I was drowning. I couldn't even do mile reps at that pace, let alone a 4-5 mile tempo. My thinking is my shoes, which were just easy day shoes that now had like 400 miles on them each (Asics Gel Kayano and Gel Nimbus) that weren't giving me the energy return. I saw an ad for Saucony Endorphin Pro 2 for $100 off and I got 20% off with a nurse's discount, which meant $95 carbon plated race day shoes! I took them out on one tempo-long run of 10 miles at a 10:00 pace where they felt amazing, but a 9:09 average mile pace still felt pretty far away. There were lots of doubts in my mind, one being that my 5k PB is literally slower than that. However, my garmin race predictor predicted I could run a 1:59 soooo I had something to go off of. Also, side note, I was able to climb a 14er in Colorado in September pretty easily, which made me so happy that running could make so many other things easier too!\n\nRace week: It happened to be a pretty stressful week with it being Halloweekend. So I didn't have the best sleep, but I also held off from drinking too. I drank electrolytes the 4 days leading up to the race and tried to carb load. With daylight savings time and 2 melatonins, I slept for 9 hours the night before the race! \n\nRace morning: I was determined to not make the same mistake as last time of waiting in the long bathroom line then being late to the start with no time to warm up or prepare anything. I woke up at 5am, took a shit, ate toast (whole wheat, which is what I always eat), peanut butter, and bananas. I did some active stretches at home and sipped on some carb+electrolyte drink on the way there. I got there very early, so I was able to use the bathroom no problem, jog, and warm up all I wanted. The weather was perfect for me at 45 degrees. I ate a honey stinger stroop waffle 15 min before starting the race. Literally walking up to the start line I made the decision to go out at sub 2 hour pace and just try to hold it. I'd rather try to sustain and have to cut back than be rushing to make up the time later if I felt good (I know thats not always recommended)\n\nThe race: I did it again, I started out too fast. My 2nd fastest mile was the first one, but that didn't ruin me too much and it gave me some nice wiggle room for pace. Some differences compared to my last half: For this one, there were no pacers, less elevation gain, lots of potholes, less people, colder, and more windy. That meant I was running alone for a couple miles, which was hard, but running was easier. Once I hit a very windy section, I made the person ahead of me my goal to catch up to, which helped a lot. That way, I could just turn my brain off and run with that person (also the wind drafting helped a bit). I didn't carry water this time either, I just timed my gel intake (at 3, 6, and 10 miles) before the water stops that I just took sips at. This race NEVER felt easy, but I just kept listening to my body about whether the pace was getting too much. My legs felt like they weren't even there, but my ankles were uncomfortable since mile 6, I'm guessing it was the shoes and they got to a point in the race around mile 8-10 where I felt like it was almost holding me back. Once I hit 10 miles, I knew I had it in the bag provided I didn't trip on any potholes. I had some energy left in the tank to do a fast 13th mile and a sprint to finish. My friends were able to drive around and cheer me on at 4 points on the course which was so helpful. The course was a little long, which most are, so I was glad I aimed a little faster than an average 9:09. I used my garmin forerunner to keep pace, mostly looking at my average and current paces. Anyway, I did it! I got 1:59:37.\n\nFuture goals: I'm gonna focus more on strength training and the 5k. Gonna try to squat a plate and get sub 25 min. Then, its on to my first marathon in June which I will probably start really training for in February. See you guys then!"

[My race report about it is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/17m1kto/not_the_day_i_hope_for_on_my_first_marathon/), it didn't go well at all with me hitting the wall around half way through. \n\nI was pretty devastated with the result because despite the poor showing, I had actually put a lot of effort into it! I signed up for DCM 24 and vowed to try again to get some redemption!\n\nI didn't really kick on with training in the first few months like I hoped I would to be honest, some of it was health related with a chest infection followed shortly after by covid (that took nearly 4 weeks to get back to normal when running) but I also just didn't have the unwavering motivation I had during Marathon training. I was maybe averaging 20K a week (more some weeks, very little others). I did a couple of half Marathons in this time that didn't go great (2:15 + finishes)\n\nEventually at the end of April I managed to get myself into gear. At this point I had put on a bit of weight 97KG, so maybe +6KG from my marathon weight. I prioritized counting calories but in this time I also managed to up my weekly mileage to 40K. It was a bit of a balancing act getting the calories right with especially the longer runs, but you could even feel the reduction in performance on shorter runs if the calories weren't right. But eventually I got on top of it.\n\nI had a couple of races in May that went ok. A 10 mile in 1:39:49 and a 5K in 27:04. Nothing amazing, but I was feeling a lot stronger than earlier in the year.\n\nIn June I had a couple of more races that went even better. A park run in 25:33 (A few seconds slower than a PB set in my 20s) and a 10 mile in 1:30:02. (PB) For context I was 88KG by the time I ran that 2nd 10miler (94Kg when I ran the first one).\n\nMarathon training started in July where my weekly average jumped up to about 60K. I also had planned all along to keep counting calories during marathon training, but to increase my calorie target significantly. I was still losing weight, but it slowed down a decent amount.\n\nNext race was an 8k at the start of August. I decided to be ambitious and aim for 40mins. This would be a 5K PB if I could keep this pace, but I was feeling pretty good so I decided to see if I could push myself. After a super congested first KM (6:30 /km) I still managed a 39:57 with a new fastest 5K PB (24:13). I weigh around 86KG\n\nAt this point I'm thinking I'm really getting the hang of this running craic. I have a half marathon at the end of August where I aim for a sub 2. I think I can do 1:55 but happy to go for sub 2 and hope to feel really strong by the end of it. I do manage the sub 2 (1:59:36, 5 minute PB) but I did not feel strong after 18k at all! It was very sunny day as far as Ireland weather goes, so I put it down to that and decided to add salt tablets to my arsenal of fuel.  \n\n\nSpeaking of fuel, I have completely changed my fueling strategy. Moved to SIS gels from High5, Am now using SIS carb drink and also eating some cola bottle jellies. It's a lot of fuel, but i feel ok taking it so happy enough.  \n  \nThe rest of the training was fine, had to do a bit of juggling around of runs here and there but I definitely did 95% of the runs. The two 20 milers on the plan went ok. One I did myself at a 6:30 pace and I felt strong, Definitely felt like I could have ran 10K more. The second I did with someone else at a 6:15 pace and found this one much tougher, was feeling it my legs at the end not as sure I could have done the extra 10K this day! But hoping the taper will sort this. \n\nI'm about 84Kg by the time Marathon comes around, 7Kg less than last year.\n\n# Race\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nStayed up in Dublin this year so a nice leisurely 7am alarm, although I got up at 6:30. Had some overnight oats for breakfast and brought half a bagel with me to eat after the bag drop. Got dropped down near the start point along the canal, was a long walk around to the bag drop and down the start line. I think I had 6k steps by the time I passed the spar shop down near the canal, so probably walked about 6k before the marathon, which was more than I expected to, but I wasn't worried about it.\n\nThe start area seemed a lot more chaotic than last year, I remember being much more grouped with the wave 4 bunch as we all made our way to the start, this year the wave 4 bunch seemed to come up against a large group of other runners\n\n**Plan**\n\nMy plan for the day is to target around a 6:10 pace for the first half, which would have me a little bit behind my A goal but if I was feeling ok I could push on later\n\n**Race**\n\nMy plan was to be out in front of the 4:30 pacers early on, and I was in the wave 4 section, but I guess they made their way up in front of the big group of other runners I mentioned so I was a decent bit behind them. Not worried about it at all plenty of time to catch them!\n\nThe first few K are a bit messy as people sort of filter into their paces. but I'm happy enough to take it easy til it clears up a bit.\n\nEverything is feeling pretty decent as we get to quays (2k-ish) and it starts to open up a bit and I can focus on pacing a bit better. Happy with hows it going. I'm trying to take a bit easier going up hills and feeling comfortable by the time we get to the park (6 or 7k in).\n\nI passed the 4:30 pacers in the park, funnily enough just as 2 out of the 3 of them dive in to the loo :D This was around the time that the 4:40 pacers passed me last year so I was feeling good that I felt good at this stage.  \n  \nNothing really too exciting going on at this stage as I'm just concentrating on maintaining my pace and keeping my HR down, everything going pretty well. Maybe around 14K i think that my calves are a little bit more tired than I'd expect them to be, but HR is perfect and feeling pretty good so I'm happy enough.\n\nThere is a decent hill around 16K I absolutely crawled up, as I think it was the beginning of the end for me last year, even still its the first time my HR has been anyway elevated, but it comes right back down when I get to the top so I'm happy out\n\nThe 20K mark is around where the wheels fell off last year so I'm somewhat cautious around that point, but energy wise i feel good, HR is still good so I'm feeling happy.\n\nPass halfway and I'm happy with my time and how I'm feeling, i know its behind the A goal but that was the plan. It's a major relief to not be in the same place as last year\n\nNot sure exactly where/when it happened but I got a stone in my shoe at one point, it wasn't sore, but I decide I'd rather get rid of it now than run on it for another 2+ hours!  \n  \nOne thing I notice this year that I didn't notice at all last year, is there was a lot of people walking around half way or just after. I felt like the only one last year which really added to my embarrassment last year.\n\nMy legs start to feel a more tired around the 24K mark and my HR is going up a little, so I decide I'll pull it back a little as there is still plenty to go. HR responds to easing up, but my legs are not really.  \n  \nI meet my family around 26.5K, I'm still going pretty ok at this point and I go over to give them a quick hug and get my swap of carb drink. As I start up again from them I feel a twinge in both of my calves, probably not good! But I keep going, and ease up the pace even a little more. I have had these twinges before in races, but usually I didn't have another 16k to run!\n\nI've had a couple more twinges by the time I pass the 30K mark, I know they are probably not going to last at this point! Around the 31k mark I decide I'll walk for a minute or two to see if it clears up, around this point the 4:30 pacers catch up to me. One of them was doing great shouting to try motivate people and I figure my best chance of a decent day is to see if I can just hang on with these! So I pick back up the running again.  \n  \nEnergy wise I'm feeling ok and I tuck in behind the front 4:30 pacer and the pace feels ok for me to do other my legs are feeling it. I'm in behind her for a few minutes and then my thigh just above my right knee starts sort of pulsing (not sore but I could feel it kind of pumping). My thigh has not been sore up to this point but I know I wont be able to stick with them for 10k, so I decide I better take a walk break again, and started making my way over to the side so I'm not slowing down in front of people.\n\nSo I navigate to the side and before I even get to slow down my right leg (I think it was my calf) completely seizes and I scuff my foot off the ground, stumble a bit but thankfully I don't fall! I've never had this happen before.\n\nI guess I'm walking now! I could walk ok on it, but anytime I tried to even get back to a jog I could feel my calf immediately.\n\nI was in a pretty dark place last year when I was forced with the reality that I was walking, but I wasn't the same this time around. Having 10K ahead of me is a much different place than having 21K, and plus I wasn't confused to what was happening like I was last year. People calling me by name last year was embarrassing for me, this year I could appreciate the support for what it was! There will be time to try figure out the why this is happening, but I physically can't run so there isn't really much I can do in the moment!\n\nI basically exclusively walk 33, 34 and 35k and most of 36, til eventually it seemed like I could run on it again. I took some extra salt tablets and took my caffeine gel (Just an FYI, the lemon caffeine gel from Decathlon is absolutely disgusting!) not sure if it would make any difference at this stage, but my stomach is holding up ok so decide it couldn't hurt. The 4:40 pacers pass me out while I'm walking, at this point I'm still not sure if I'll get running again and I'm wondering how many more pacing groups are going to pass me!\n\nWhen I get back running again I've about 6k left, I decide I'll walk up any hills I come across as I'd really like to try run the last 2 or 3KM without stopping. From about 3kish out I hitch my wagon to a woman who seems to be getting on ok and I try stick with her. I don't know was she a celebrity or had her name written in lights on her bib but it seemed like a tonne of people where cheering her on specifically! I must say after a while of this I did feel a bit conscious to be essentially following her.  \n  \nMy crew were around the RDS again somewhere, they had gotten up early to get the car inside the loop this year so they were much better able to get around. I went over for some high fives, I didn't dare stop for hugs this time!\n\nMy legs have been feeling ok-ish for the last couple of KM so I think the immediate threat of cramping is gone, so when I see the 800M to go sign and I decide to give one last final push. The crowd once you got over the canal was amazing. My 42K pace was 6:16 and the 0.5 after that was 5:36 so I wasn't lighting the world alight or anything but a decent kick on at least.\n\nUnlike last year, I hold my hands up crossing the line\n\n\n\n**Post-race**\n\nMy legs are in absolute bits after the finish line, my calves and hamstrings are telling my all about what they thought of it. I get my medal and goodie bag and make my way to the bag drop. I find a step to try change my top and put on a top and a coat as I think it started raining shortly after I finished.\n\nI thought there was a lot of walking last year, I was absolutely disgusted when I hobbled for about 10 minutes to find myself at the pub that's beside the exit last year! We walked back to the car which was just the far side of the canal, went back to my friends house where I grabbed a shower and then we stopped for food on the way home.\n\n# Reflection\n\nI'm nowhere near as dissapointed as last year, I did what I could on the day, but at least for another 6 months, my Marathon time will continue to be an outlier! ***Maybe*** there was a few more minutes on the table if I wasn't as cautious when I started running again, but judging how my legs felt afterwards, i'm not so sure!\n\nI just want to try execute one of these things right! But 46 minute PB is something I guess!\n\nI at least felt like the effort I gave on Sunday was like someone who might have trained for the Marathon! I didn't really feel like that last year. Also I ran the 30k faster than any training run (very slightly, 1 second per KM faster) so at least it was an unknown. Last year I was done at the half after running 10 minutes slower than my then half PB.\n\nAgain I come through unscathed. My legs have been pretty sore since, but typical post marathon things and improving every day, nothing injured as far as I can tell, so thankful for that! \n\nNow starts the process of figuring out what I need to change or improve because I must be doing something wrong.\n\nWeight: I'm another 7Kg lighter than this time last year, but still maybe another 7Kg overweight according to BMI so that's an obvious one to work on. I'm down \\~20Kg or so from when I got serious about running in Feb 23, so I have to reflect on the improvements I've made to get where I am.   \n  \nMileage: I'm 14K short of 1000 miles done for the year, not huge numbers compared to some people but I'd imagine its probably more than average for +4 finishers. I did over 1000 miles last year too.\n\nS&C: non existent, needs to be an area of focus\n\nTraining plan: I sort of mashed two plans together this year. Both were structured similarly but I liked the midweek runs of one and the weekend runs of the other so I decided to combine them. It seemed logical enough to me, but maybe a mistake! I feel in general I improved a lot as a runner this year, even if I didn't get the Marathon result I was looking for, so it must not have been all bad.\n\nPace: People who look at my timing mat paces will say the classic case of someone going out too fast. And maybe that's true. But if it is the case, the problem I'm having is setting my target because my pacing was spot on for what I planned to do. My Half PB was sub 2 on a very warm day, so I felt pacing for 6:10 average was reasonable, even me being a tad conservative. Maybe 2 x half + 20 isn't enough for me and I should be adjusting that to 2x half + 30 or something.\n\nFueling: Obviously a huge improvement over last year. A lot more focus on carb loading the week of. On course I took 5 gels, roughly 800/900 ml of carb drink (+ 3 gels worth of carbs roughly) and probably another 2 gels worth of cola bottles. I also took salt tablets every 5K, alternating between 1 and 2 tablets at a time. I had planned to take one more gel but I didn't seem necessary as I took more carb drink than planned at the end for hydration purposes\n\nWater: I didn't drink much water out on course outside of the carb drink. I drank at every stop last year and I felt it contributed to me feeling sick. I skipped most of the water stops this year, maybe using every 3rd, but that was similar to my long runs where I would have minimal water outside of the carb drink. I guess this could be an area to improve. I didn't feel like I was sweating too much at all thought so I felt I was on top of it, but maybe not!\n\n# Whats Next\n\nRecover this week. My muscles are very sore so plenty of rest and a couple of small walks. Won't run til the weekend at the earliest and even then will only do something very short.\n\nGet back into a routine with running. Last year November, December and especially January were very light months for me running wise, I would like to keep ticking over better this year in November and December\n\nDiet. Christmas will obviously be a tough time to be focusing on weight, but November for sure with the reduced mileage is a decent opportunity to get back on top of it (after I've recovered from Dublin)\n\nSpring Marathon. Limerick (May) is booked, training will start back up again in January. I'm doing it with a friend who I was hoping the Dublin result would put me in her ball park of a level so we'd be able to push each other on, but I have been humbled and put in my box!\n\nDCM25. I am 95% sure I will go again. The crowds and the buzz are absolutely amazing. The logistics around it are putting me off it, but I think I'll suck it up for another crack at it. Am I able for 2 marathons in a year? I'm not sure there is even evidence I'm able for 1!"

        "Texto": "Thought id give some of my own feedback on my first marathon to this sub since I was a lurker all through out my training, and this sub was really helpful for me in preparation for my first marathon. Some background, I (M32) did not come from really any sort of advanced sports/running background. Enjoyed football and cycling/mountain biking in my past but nothing competitive above a highschool JV level. I started to pick up running a bit during COVID to pass the time and more seriously in early 2022 when I ran my first half marathon.\n\nRace Information\n\nName: Baystate Marathon\n\nDate: October 20th, 2025\n\nDistance: 26.2 miles\n\nLocation: Lowell, MA\n\nTime: 2:54:XX\n\n**Goals**\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|A|Finish|*Yes*|\n|B|Sub 3|*Yes*|\n|C|Sub 2:55|*Yes*|\n\n**Splits**\n\n|Mile|Time|\n|:-|:-|\n||\n|1|6:38|\n|2|6:37|\n|3|6:37|\n|4|6:32|\n|5|6:37|\n|6|6:40|\n|7|6:34|\n|8|6:33|\n|9|6:32|\n|10|6:34|\n|11|6:31|\n|12|6:33|\n|13|6:31|\n|14|6:31|\n|15|6:35|\n|16|6:39|\n|17|6:35|\n|18|6:38|\n|19|6:35|\n|20|6:41|\n|21|6:41|\n|22|6:45|\n|23|6:39|\n|24|6:45|\n|25|6:40|\n|26|6:45|\n\n\n\n**Training**\n\nDecided I wanted to run a fall marathon earlier this year but didnt know what one specifically. Targeting an October marathon, knew I needed to start a training block around June so used the first 6 months of the year to build my base up to about 30-40 miles / week. My last race (half marathon) was in fall of 2022 and I had kept some running in 2023 but just with life priorities, didnt have a ton of time to dedicate to running. Previously had used one of the Garmin plans for my first half marathon two years ago (ran 1:25:XX) and liked it a lot. I knew I had it in me from my half that I could probably go sub 3:30 initially for my first marathon, maybe more if I really buckled down. Decided to be pretty aggressive with it and do Pfitz 18/55. I set up my target to be 3 hours and then target paces for each training run type from there, knowing it would be tough to start, but go out with the mindset run the hard runs as hard as I can, easy runs easy, and listen to my body to not injure myself. At the time Chicago automatic qualifier was 3:10 for my age group so thought that would be attainable. Living in Boston, running that is the ultimate goal, but with the cutoff times dropping significantly YoY knew it would be a pipe dream for my first marathon\n\nFollowed the plan pretty much 95%. Adjusted for my schedules a bit when needed but still hit all the runs I needed to in a week. What ended up really working for me was ditching the \"pace targets\" I set for myself end I did a mix of training targets based on paces and HR for the types of runs I was doing\n\nMarathon pace: easy warm ups / cool down but run as close to 6:50 as I could handle\n\nLong Run: keep HR between 140-150 pushing / relaxing pace as needed. Would mix in strides and occasional speed work on tired legs later in runs to change it up and get a better feel for it\n\nLactate / Aerobic runs: run intervals as hard as my body could handle\n\nRecovery: kept these super easy\n\nThe ups and downs of training\n\nFirst 20 mile run: Did on an extremely hot and humid day (even early) and in hindsight was probably a dumb idea. This run cooked me (literally and figuratively) and made me rethink this whole plan in general\n\nFirst tune up race: Treehouse Half Marathon. This was a mixed bag. I set out to beat my previous PR of 1:25:XX and was on track for a 1:23:XX for 75% of the race. For anyone that has run this knows the last \\~6 miles are a mix of some large hills with a massive one at mile 10 and these absolutely killed me. I ended up not PR'ing but still in the 1:25:XX range. Felt pretty good about the race but in the back of my mind was worried about a sub 3 target\n\n5K Tune up: Not really in the Pfitz plan but fell on one of the tune up days and I had already signed up for a local 5K. Was not a very large field but ended up winning with a 17:59. Looking back... this felt harder than the marathon or any half that I ran\n\nI highly recommend the Pfitz book / plan for anyone wanting to push themselves. It was hard but exceptionally rewarding and the book itself is a great resource for all things marathon training as well\n\nNutrition (general): Only thing I really changed was eating a shitload more. I had never felt huger like marathon training hunger eating everything in sight like a pubescent teenage boy. I did not cut out alcohol except during my taper\n\nBy the end of my training Chicago automatic qualifiers dropped to 2:55 and Boston as well (even though knew i would need to run substantially faster for cutoffs).. Feeling pretty good, I set my pace targets to 2:55 with a goal to qualify for Chicago or bust.\n\n**Pre-Race**\n\nTaper: As I learned on this sub and others taper tantrums are real and I hated the taper. Felt like I was losing fitness and was getting anxious. I followed the plan and in the week prior really carb loaded (300-500g/day) and focus on electrolytes and hydration. Upping carb loading and electrolytes even more a few days out from the race.\n\nDay before: Picked up my bib and just stayed off my feet. Ate carb heavy but lighter than usually and went to bed early.\n\nDay of: Slept pretty well and fueled in the morning with coffee, bagel, and a Gatorade. Got to the race around 6 AM and it was extremely cold so warmed up in the Umass rec center while waiting and snacking on some cliff blocks. As learned from this sub.... Poop then poop some more.... Pee then poop again. Getting it all helped feel great on the start line\n\n**Race**\n\nWeather could not have been better, maybe a touch warm in the sun. Sunny cool day to start and warming up to around 60 by race end. Picked the AF3 for my race day shoes... totally worth the money. These things are like moon boots. I have several other super shoes but nothing compared to these.\n\nMiles 1-3: For this race the marathon and half run concurrently. First 3 miles are with the half group so its a bit crowded. I had the urge to get ahead of the crowds but did not want to blow it so kept in my pace ranges\n\nMiles 3-13: Mentally went a bit different than the 10/10/10 rule but similar 13/7/6. Knew if I could keep my half around 1:26 to 1:27 id be okay then just a easy 7 mile and 6 mile run after. Managed to split a 1:26:XX and was feeling great. The 2nd half being mostly unknown territory for me. I really wanted too but didnt push, just went for keeping as close to a even split as I could\n\nMiles 14-20: These were tough. The field was pretty thinned out and I was running most of these miles alone. Went on a rollercoaster of feeling okay to \"why the hell am I doing this\"\n\nMiles 20-Finish: \"WTF\" I couldn't tell if it was numbness or intense pain but this is where the legs started to feel like concrete. Hardest 6 miles I've ever ran. Seeing my friends at mile 22 say \"how does he look so great\" made me think this was all in my head. Started to gain on a small group and that gave me the energy needed to push through the finish line. This was hardest ive ever had to move my legs\n\nFuel: Honey stingers worked best for me throughout training. Did 1 gel every 30 mins. I made my own \"elixr\" of Gatorade, LMNT and caffeine, and more Gatorade powder mixed in to sip on through the run and help the gels go down. I hate carrying a bottle when running but do think this extremely sugary salty mix helped a lot\n\n**Post Race**\n\nTook a few mins before I could process any thoughts in my head crossing the finish line seeing 2:54:XX as I came around the corner. Hobbling around I immediately called my girlfriend to meet up at the finish and grabbed a snack and a soda and rest on a bench. Didnt hang around long at the race and headed out to grab some celebratory beers with friends at a Brewery. Overall highly recommend Baystate for anyone in NE looking for a extremely well run (and cheap) marathon.\n\nLearned that 26.2 is extremely humbling, nothing compared to anything I've run before and feel extremely fortunate that all things aligned well race day to perform as I did.\n\nWhat's next? Well I got the marathon itch now... Just got accepted for Chicago 2025 through automatic qualifier and looking at spring marathons. Goal is to get a \"comfortable\" BQ for Boston 2026/2027\n\nFor anyone else also obsessive of their running data like me. Garmin Race Predictor had me at a 2:57 and Runalyze at a 2:58 pre race (as the target if i was 100% marathon shape. I was only at 60% and it said 3:10 in current condition). Post race Garmin was at a 2:52 and Runalyze a 2:55 (70% marathon shape)..\n\nMade with a new race report generator created by u/herumph."

I'm a college student from the midwestern USA who has run cross country and track races with my run club, and have done 2 half marathons (in April and June 2024). I'm currently studying in Sweden for the fall semester, and decided that spending my time here training for a marathon would be a great way to explore the beautiful nature here in Sweden, and give me something to work towards to help alleviate any possible homesickness. This was a great choice because there are so many great trails to run here with beautiful landscapes, although it is WAY more hilly than I was used to haha.\n\n##Training\nI made my own plan for this since I don't really like following plans someone else has made since they are tough to fit into/match your available schedule. My 18 week plan started the day after I ran my June half marathon. I started with a month of base building, and then gradually added marathon pace speedwork. I ended up with most of my weeks being in the mid-40s of miles per week, and my peak week was 52 miles. The long runs got much easier as I went. I was absolutely cooked after my first 15 miler, but soon enough I was telling myself \"only a half marathon left\" as motivation on some of the longer runs. I had a 20 miler, and 2 18 milers that I did, and for the 20 miler, I'm 99% sure I bonked/hit the wall 17.5 miles in. I was feeling like throwing up and couldn't take down the gel I had planned at 18 miles which I'm sure did not help. Then it felt like I had just done a sprint finish at a race, and got told I actually had to keep going for another few miles. I went into my race scared that I was going to experience this again because it was so unpleasant. I'm not sure if I tapered well. My weeks were 40, 30 and 13 miles (would've been ~20 miles if race day weren't there). I don't know if I overtapered on the third week, but I usually like to rest a bit more before races than other people I run with so I don't know, I think it was alright.\n\n##Pre-race\nI nearly missed my bus because my ticket was marked wrong and I had to run to a different spot at the Gothenburg station than I thought, which sucked. I was 30 seconds away from missing the bus entirely. My phantom shin splint pain from tapering felt like it may have been aggravated from that so that was not awesome. I arrived at my hostel room in Uppsala at nearly midnight after switching to a train in Herrljunga, and another in Stockholm. Basically, I was beat. I woke up tired and choked down 2 bananas and a bit of a bagel that I couldn't finish. The start and finish lines were at the top of a giant hill which made me a bit nervious, but there was a cool castle at the top which was very nice. People were looking at me a bit weird for wearing only shorts and a tank, but it was like 45 degrees so jokes on them they probably overheated during the race while I was comfortable. My fueling strategy was to take a regular Gu gel at miles 5, 10, 14, 18, & 22. Also, to get water from stations only when I was thirsty, and possibly grab a banana or part of a banana around half way.\n\n##Race\nI really wanted to try to not bonk if at all possible, and keep my pacing at exactly 7:37/mile if possible to hit my 3:20:00 goal. I knew it was really ambitious, but probably possible if I were as efficient as possible with my pace. The first half felt really fun. I was cruising at a pace that felt easy thanks to the taper, and we were going through some beautiful trails with amazing fall colors, as well as by a bunch of curious horses at a farm we passed. There were a lot more people around me than I imagined there would be for a race that I couldn't find much about online at all other than a mention or 2 on Reddit and like 1 Youtube video from a Swede. This was great as it helped keep me in check pace-wise. In fact, the people around me I think had the same goal as me (3:20), but frequently were actually slightly behind pace, so I passed a good amount of people even though that made me a bit nervous. At half way someone next to me had a very short conversation in Swenglish which was kind of cool since my Swedish skills are horrible, but short conversations are all you can really have when running a race. I got a really short burst of energy here, and found myself in front of everyone nearby now, so I was really hoping that I wouldn't take a wrong turn. The half marathon runners caught up to me and started passing, which made it a bit harder to run on the narrow paths, but I'm also glad they did because I didn't have to worry about wrong turns anymore, and they also helped make sure I didn't lose motivation and slow down. \n\nAround mile 16 I started counting down the miles in my head, so I think it's safe to say that here is where the grind started for me. At mile 20 I knew that I was in uncharted territory and could hit the wall or something at any moment, but I felt strong enough that I could make it to mile 22 which was my next planned gel. I actually started getting tired and took it a bit early, but it worked out. My watch then died around mile 23, and so I had no idea if I was on pace to hit my goal or not. My body was aching pretty badly as this point and I was a little tempted to slow down, but I knew I would regret it if I did after the race. Coming up towards the finish was a slog, but when I saw the castle (Uppsala Slott) again, I knew it was the home stretch. This actually brought me very little joy though, as the finish was all uphill, and included running up stairs (!!!) so I knew that I was far from cruising to the finish. As soon as I lifted my leg for the first time to start on the stairs I instantly felt how bad my legs were feeling. Lucky for me though the finish was only about 15 seconds away after the stairs, and I cruised to the finish.\n\nI could not see the clock as I finished, but I assumed I didn't hit 3:20 since I felt like I was slowing down a bit on miles 23-26. I went and got my bag and sat down after walking around for about 5 minutes. I opened up the race results and I absolutely couldn't believe that I had beaten my ambitious goal by a mere 20 seconds. Tears came to my eyes I was so happy and proud of myself, and I kept getting random bursts of emotion for quite a while after.\n\n##Final Thoughts\nI heard a lot that the marathon is only half done at mile 20, and honestly it didn't feel like this to me. It felt like the amount of effort I had to put in went up linearly, so I didn't even start to feel anything until mile 7 or so, but it just piled on a little extra effort every mile. Maybe I just paced it well, but I didn't feel like miles 20-26 were THAT much harder than miles 16-20. For me at least, I think 16 or 17 was the half way point, but from that one experience I had with hitting the wall, I suppose that would definitely make it exponentially harder. Moral of the story: don't speed up when you know you shouldn't, you feel better.\n\nI feel that this went about as well as possible for my first marathon. It was a great route with a scenic atmosphere in a location that I may not get to visit again. I paced myself about as good as I could, and honestly being terrified of messing up my pacing was what silenced the goblin in my head that would be tricking me into speeding up if this race were shorter. I'm so glad I was able to have such a great experience for my first marathon, and if you are going to be in Europe around October, definitely consider the Uppsala Marathon!!! It's a really nice race that deserves a bit more attention.\n\nMade with [Strava race report generator](https://race-report-gen.jezl.xyz/).",

By this year, I was habitually running 10KM five days a week, with my times coming in regularly under an hour, entirely on my own, and my coworker Bill--who is also a runner--said I could probably get trained up for a half marathon with a relatively short training plan. I was kind of intimidated, though, with it being double what my normal daily run is, and kept putting it off...\n\nUntil my boyfriend broke up with me. A week after talking proposals with my parents. Over text. One of the reasons he cited was that he didn't like running with me because we 'couldn't talk during', and that I didn't seem to care enough about that. \n\nCue me signing up for a half-marathon almost out of spite.\n\nUnfortunately, I signed up at a time where work got really busy, really fast. In my distraction, the timeline for training caught up with me about four weeks before the race, so I had to limit myself to a four week training plan. The plan amounted to the following:   \n1. Monday-Friday: Engage with my normal run schedule, the usual 10K.   \n2. Saturday: a shorter-than-usual run, just a 5K, mixed with a strength-building workout. I'd been doing weight training all year, but lately I'd gotten bored and started swapping it out with a pole-dancing class near me, which is a lot of fun.   \n3. Sunday: Training run. I'd do a longer run than usual these days, with an emphasis on distance rather than speed, and each week I'd increase the distance.   \n  \nThe exception was this last week: On Sunday I did a full 20km on my training run, but limited myself to nothing more than 5.5km throughout the week so I wouldn't over-train and injure myself.   \n  \nI was also doing a regular stretching plan to keep myself flexible. I started a plan that's oriented towards helping people achieve the splits, but had to be really mindful to not push myself too hard and accidentally pull something right before the race. By race day I'm about 95% of the way to the splits, tho, and I can't help but think that keeping those joints loose helped a lot. \n\nI'll admit I had a couple factors in how my training proceeded went that likely hindered my final performance:  I don't own a lot of fancy running gear aside from my shoes due to being relatively broke, so no real carrying hydration with me. I got into the habit of pausing my long runs after 12 or so kilometers to pop into a nearby dollar store and buying a cheap bottle of water, which I'd carry for the rest of the run. You don't STOP mid race to hydrate, so, making that a habit probably wasn't smart. I also never had the money to spare on running fuel, so I never used it--and like my buddy Bill drilled into me when I started this  hobby, No New Things On Race Day. \n\n# Pre-race\n\nI'd planned ahead by arranging for a friend to come with me so she could drive home afterwards, since I knew from the training runs I'd be SORE. I'll admit due to nerves I didn't get the best sleep the night before--I had to wake up early to get to Jamestown, so I kept startling awake out of fear I'd miss my alarm.   \nOn the ride to the race, I had myself a few Greek yogurts with protein, and brought a Gatorade Zero or two in my bag. From experience, I knew I hated the nauseated feeling I get if I overeat before anything longer than a 5km, so between the desire to keep it light and being anxious I probably didn't get the carbs I really needed. \n\nRight before the race, somehow I ended up at the front of the line, knowing that WAS not going to last. I was nervous--this IS my first race longer than an 8k--but I felt good. Ready. I turned on my music, got my thumb ready on my phone's GPS, and waited for the airhorn. \n\n# Race\n\nHonestly, I'm not gonna break my race down mile-by-mile like some folks do because a lot of my time on that track was a blur. A beautiful blur, though; Virginia in October is absolutely gorgeous, and the weather was PERFECT--cool, clear, crisp air and the bluest of skies to frame all those flaming colors. Most of the trail was shaded by those trees, keeping the sun off our heads for more than a mile or so at a time, and the rest of the time you could smell the salt off the nearby beach or the corn off the fields. \n\nDue to starting up at the front for SOME REASON, where I DEFINITELY should not have been, I spent pretty much the entire first 5k maintaining my pace and watching myself get passed by every Tom, Dick and Harry coming up behind me. Discouraging, but also I think it woke up a bit of my competitive spirit, because I managed to keep a pretty consistent pace for the entire first half of the race.  Didn't catch up to 98 percent of them, but I did hit 10km well under an hour, just gliding along, and for a brief moment I even let myself start to fantasize not just about a sub-2:15, but a sub-2!\n\nOf course, you can see by my splits that my second half wasn't so great. I hit the wall, HARD, and my pace slowed as a result, especially on the last 5km or so. This was where the lack of fuel and probably my nervous sleep the night before started to show--I had to start walking for just a few meters every kilometer or so, then pushing myself to start running again. I'd also started to feel the resurgence of some stiffness in my right hip that I've been working out, enough to make me wonder if it's something worth seeing a professional over. Fortunately, I was also running to a playlist my friends had helped prepare the week before as encouragement--some really bombastic Star Wars tracks helped push me through the last leg.   \nThat, and that competitive streak came back. I found myself trading places time and time again with this tall ginger dude in a black-and-white tye-dyed Tshirt. At some point I got it in my head I HAD to finish before him no matter what, and that helped me power through the last kilometer or so out of sheer ferocity.  \n  \n(I did beat him, by the way. So I at least had that.) \n\n# Post-race \n\nI powered my way past the finish line literally dripping with sweat. A child handed me a medal, and I found my way to the water bottles and immediately downed two of them, which was probably excessive but felt DAMN good. After wobbling over to my friend, who'd moved locations from where I expected and was cheering me on with a sign she'd cobbled together mid-race, we went and grabbed a banana and a couple of cereal bars--they'd offered pizza and beer, but if I'd eaten anything that greasy that soon I would have thrown up. \n\nI didn't realized I'd placed third in my age group until after I finished my food. So, holy shit, that happened. \n\nAlso, I noticed an interesting contradiction in my running times. See, I turned on my normal tracker (I use ZRX's Zombies, Run) with the GPS at the starting line, just to be able to log this run properly. But the time it notes is slightly different from my official race time--it claims I hit 13.1 miles at 2:10, not almost 2:17. I know hand-marked races can vary in their accuracy, and GPS can be weird in places with bad reception, so I'm not fully sure what to make of that--that's why I'm not sure if I actually DID get under 2:15 or not. Any opinions on the matter would be much appreciated. \n\nMy friend took me to get poke bowls after to celebrate. Mmmmmmmmm fish. \n\n# Reflection:\n\nHonestly, I'm really really glad I did this at last. Kind of annoyed at myself for flagging as hard as I did in the back half--just a SLIGHTLY better performance, a more mindful fuel plan, and I would have gotten under the 2:15 mark easy. It just goes to show what a difference the last-minute preparation really makes, not just all the training that goes before that. \n\nI'd like to try again next year, aiming for the goal I missed. If I do, I'll definitely be saving up for some proper mid-race fuel to train on, see if that makes a difference too. Once I get a time under 2:15 OFFICIALLY on the books, who knows? Aiming for a sub-2? A full marathon?   \nDon't think I'm gonna wait to get dumped again to find out. "

        "Texto": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** TCS Toronto Waterfront Marathon\n* **Date:** October 20th 2024\n* **Distance:** 42.2 Kilometre\n* **Location:** Toronto, Canada\n* **Strava:** https://www.strava.com/activities/12702863091\n* **Time:** 3:43:09\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Didn't Walk | ✅ |\n| B | Sub 4:00:00 | ✅ |\n| C | Sub 3:45:00 | ✅ |\n\n### Splits\n| 5K Split| Time |\n|------|------|\n| 00-05 | 25:52\n| 05-10 | 25:47\n| 10-15 | 25:23\n| 15-20 | 25:54\n| 20-25 | 22:56\n| 25-30 | 25:24\n| 30-35 | 26:45\n| 35-40 | 28:02\n| 40-42 | 11:19\n\n### Training\nI set out 2 life goals to achieve outside of work: 1) complete IRONMAN OTTAWA in 2026 and; 2) run a marathon sub 3hr or close to it within 3 years. With that in mind, I began my training journey in 2023.\n\nPrior to 2023, I had what I believe to be a minimum base cardio endurance. Sporadically since my university year, I trained and participated in several road cycling races, one sprint triathlon event and three half-marathons. I also trained and completed two half marathons in 2023, achieving 1:43mins and 1:44mins respectively. As such, I'm not a complete stranger when it comes to putting in the works for my two life goals. The only difference would be 1) run volume; 2) run quality and; 3) nutrition. \n\nMy journey to full marathon officially began in November 2023. I could have given myself an off season after my half-marathons but given I just came off from a rather successful 2023 season with two half-marathons accomplished, I was in post-race afterglow and couldn't wait to restart training again. Also, Among the three sports, I consider running to be my weakest. Thus, it's essential that I need to take more time and effort to improve my running compare the other two. \n\nFrom November through February, I ran every other day through winter, whether it rained or snowed. Every week I would accumulate 40-65km per week, typically with a 12K run to start off the week, followed by 15K, 18K, and  a 20K+ weekend run. At this point of my training, I have absolutely no concept of \"zone\" or \"80/20\"; I ran purely based on weather and feel. During this time, I had several PB breakthroughs and felt I hitted my prime running fitness and would continue to maintain this...until I finally hit a snag in mid-February. \n\nMy left ankle and my calf started to hurt a lot and i experienced physical exhaustion where after a short run I could barely stand upright. A visit to the physio found out that my left calf and ankle is significantly weaker than my right calf/ankle. I had to to take 1 and half week off to recover and was given instruction to do calf raise and big toe stretch everyday. During this time, I did a lot of self-research on running form, HR Zones, LTT, 80%/20% approach, cadence vs. strides. Frankly it was a little bit overwhelming so I took what I know and could understand (very half-baked research) and incorporate as much as I can into my training runs. Since then, I followed a pyramidal training 75%/15%/10% in all my runs. The result has been satisfactory. I'm more aware of my HR zones and can stay consistent in zone 2, though my pace have suffered. I do way less tempo pace runs because I got scared into thinking that any hard runs will lead me into an injury and could derail my entire training regime. \n\nBetween March to May, training stayed largely consistent with marked improvement in the HR zone. I could run in zone 2 without constant monitoring. Weekend long runs became much easier to deal with. I also joined my local run club (Markville Run Crew) and I was imparted with various wisdom from the elite sub 3hr runners. I tried adding 1 sprint session per week as I have been told that a sprint session or hill repeat is necessary to increase speed (duh). Unfortunately, these sprint sessions kept injuring my left calf and ankle, which messes up my weekly training schedule. \n\nIn June, cycling outdoor became a priority in preparation for the Toronto Triathlon Festival in early July. Weekend running became long bike rides with brick 10K runs (brick sessions are cycling + running back-to-back). After the event ended, July onward I ditched cycling and focused dominantly on running, with emphasis on swimming in between because I decided to YOLO signup for a 3.8K point-to-point Lake Ontario swim event in early August. Between late July to mid-August, I suffered my second fitness setback. The swimming event went well but for some reason after the race when I restarted my training runs, I see a significant plummet in my pace, heart rate and recovery; I felt weak, high heart rate (both resting and during running), ran in a slow pace with uneven breathing pattern. Naturally I freaked out and want to get to the bottom of the issue. Was it because of the house renovation with the dust and heavy particulates? Was it something I caught from Lake Ontario? Or is it a nutrient thing (kitchen was in renovation; couldn't cook; week long takeouts)?? I ended up visiting the hospital citing respiratory issue. They did everything from blood checkup to ECG and the result is zero problem and the nurse was surprised to see that my resting HR is 45. Maybe I just had another physical exhaustion but less apparent than the first time. \n\nFrom late August to early October, I wrestled with my running fitness; sometimes i feel great and other times terrible. Despite the constant highs and lows, I managed to put more volume into my runs, increasing my weekend long runs to minimum 25K+. In addition, weekdays are mostly done in tempo pace leading up to to the race, with one of the four sessions converted to indoor sprint sessions: 10 x 2mins interval pace w/ 1min walk in between. (I added flutter kick sessions in my swim with fins which i think helped a lot with increasing both flexibility and strength in my ankle). Late September to early October I brought my weekend long run up to 30K easy pace, 35K mix of easy/tempo pace, and finally wrapped up my training with a 30K tempo pace. I wound down my runs from the week of 7th with downward progression of 15K to 5K. The week of October 14th I concentrated on recovery, getting good sleep (I found taking magnesium and melatonin really helped) hydrate a lot and eating healthy.    \n\n### Pre-race\nOn Saturday I planned on a 5K shakeout run from Union Station to the Run Expo. Fortunately, my university friend decided to challenge himself in a 5K run because he got a free Waterfront 5K bib from another friend of his. I decided to make that my shakeout run instead, running side by side supporting him. It was nice for once being the a supporter of another person's running journey instead of a supportee. After that was done, I went to pick up my first marathon bib of my life so far. Seeing it in person and my name on the marathon wall really put into perspective of just how far I have come since my first running event in 2015. In 24 hours, I would try to accomplish something that in the past that I never thought would be possible: running all 42.2 kilometre in an official event. I spent the remaining Saturday checking my running gears:\n\n* Hat: Salomon cross cap\n* Sunglasses: Rockbro Photochromatic Sunglasses\n* Topwear: Nnormal Race Tank Singlet\n* Bottomwear: 2XU Aero 5\" Shorts 2.0\n* Waist: Salomon Advanced Skin Racing Belt\n* Socks: Injinji Midweight Mini Crew Toe Socks\n* Shoes: ASICS Superblast 2\n* Gels: Precision Fuel (PF) 30 gel x 4; PF 90 Gel X 1; Electrolyte capsule X 1\n* Waterbottle: HydraPak Skyflask 350ml\n\nCarbloaded with Korean Black-bean sauce noodle (it never failed me once). Slept around 8:30AM to catch the 6:40AM regional bus to Union Station.\n\n### Race\nWoke up around 4:30AM on Sunday. Had my trusty breakfast for literally all my races thus far: 2 stroopenwaffles, 1 Peanut Butter Sandwich, 2 bananas. Works like a charm. Spent the next 1hr doing static stretches and preparing my 350ml carb drink. Took my sweet time in the washroom with my #1 and #2 business because I hate porta-potty and there are long lineups all the time for them. Took the bus down and as usual, Toronto traffic delay on the Gardiner almost made me late. Fortunately, it wasn't too bad but I had only 20mins to drop off my bag and do some stretches inside the corral. \n\nMy plan was to maintain 5:30min/km from the start and slowly bring that pace to 5:20min/km to Bathurst. I would keep that pace all the way until I hit the 21K mark and steadily bring up the pace up to 5:10min/km, with a sprint to the finish. That didn't happen. I flew right out of the gate 5:10min/km and maintained this pace for 65%-70% of the race. My hydration plan is simple; take gatorade at every other water station but consume only half cups of it because I know I hydrated enough days prior to the race that my body is carrying sufficient liquid. My gel strategy is 1 gel every 7KM and I set that on repeat on my Garmin 265S. I tried a variety of gels already in the past: GU is very sticky and requires liquid to wash it down. Honey Stinger is smoother but it's too sweet. Precision Fuel is an incredible find for me. It's not too sweet and it's ridiculously smooth; it just slides off your tongue into your stomach. \n\nFor the first half, I'm laser focused on a steadily pace of 5:10min/km with a mindset of \"Now that it's finally happening, i'm committed to keep it\". I also make sure my breathing pattern is consistent and keeping my heart rate steady around 165bpm. I had no trouble navigating around the first incline but a lot of people around me are running past me. Thankfully after all this time, I simply told myself  \"No big deal it's only 3KM of the race. Trust the (revised) plan.\". I always find the stretch from Bloor St W down to Bathurst to be best part of the race. Huge crowd turnout and support. There is shade from the building and Bathurst is downhill. I did pick up the pace here unintentionally to 5:05min/km but since my bpm is stable, I pushed onward. \n\nNothing exciting to report on the run from Fort York Blvd onto Lakeshore Blvd West. It's flat and next to the lakefront. It does suck to pass Ontario Place and seeing it demolished (screw you Doug Ford). I hugged closer to the right side of the road for the tree foliage and a group of runners for slight drafting. By 18K-19K, I caught up with the 3:45 pace bunny and passed him. This stretch does get pretty boring so every now and then I struck up a small conversation with people around me to make sure my mind doesn't wander. When the route began to divert and split between half and full marathon runners, I know in my heart this is where the real battle starts; It's unknown territory for me. I did a quick mental checklist on myself to see if i'm physically fine; hydrated, fueled and pace is being maintained...? Honestly, the 18-21K segment takes place under our elevated expressway so my watch is showing me running in god mode of 2:35min/km. So going by feel I was constant in my pace lol.\n\nFrom 23K to 27K i know this is where I get tested. There is a slightly steep-ish climb at the 26K mark and an even steeper climb over a bridge at the 27K mark. In my training runs, I always include hills and climbs but most of the time, they happen in earlier part of the run, not later. Knowing that I might have some trouble running over these climbs, I slowed down slightly and focused on just going over without losing too much time. It is nice to see yourself run past people on the climbs and that gave me somewhat of a mental boost that all the training hill runs on paid off. However, the mental boost didn't last long because the stretch from 28K to 31K quickly sapped all my good vibes away. \n\nRunning on Lakeshore Blvd East was the worst part of the entire race; it's straight, seemingly endless, no shades, barely any crowd support and you're completely exposed to the afternoon sun. It was demoralizing and i could feel it had significant impact on my mind and body. It brought the pace up from 5:10min/km to 5:15min-5:20min/km. Personally, the slowing pace is still within my expectation but I didn't expect this is where my pace suffers. Passing the 31K to 33K, my body is starting to take its toll and between 32K to 33K turnaround, it's a sneaky incline that I wasn't prepared for. It was a grueling run upward and my pace suffered further. After passing 34K which I thank inwardly that I could slightly relax on a gradual downhill, but dreaded that I have to do the same long stretch all over again. \n\nBetween 35K to 37K is where I began to hit \"the wall\". My calves are surprisingly alright at this point but a searing pain began to grow in my right hamstring. My stride shortened and my pace dropped further into 5:35min/km. My mind wavered a little so I took a quick shut-eye for 3 seconds to refocus and used one of the taller participants ahead of me for shade and pacing lol? At this point, i'm desperately grasping at anything that gives me the will to continue running. When the long stretch finally ended, I had to contend with the bridge again and this time, I barely have any energy left in the tank. I took my last gel at 35K mark and tried to drink from my carb bottle but i spat it out because my throat couldn't take it anymore. Fortunately, I willed myself over that hill at the cost of even more time with a pace of 5:50min/km. 3 more kilometre left and the boisterous crowd supporting resumed once more which gave me some boost in the mind but not physically. I was contesting a right hamstring soreness and my breathing became distorted and laborious . I'm officially spent by the time i hit 41K. However, seeing the familiar landscape that leads up to the finish line gave me a second wind. I pushed myself to the utmost limit, and my stride and cadence returned temporarily, running as fast (bringing my pace back up to 5:20min/km) as I could until I passed the finish line. There was no obligatory victory arm raise but I did let loose a animalist shout coupled with a double fist pump knowing that I fucking did it.                  \n\n### Post-race\nReceiving that medal to me felt like the biggest moment for me this year. I stared at it while hobbled to the nearest shady area that I could find. Any motion that resembles bending the knee or sitting down was awful because by now, both of my hamstrings and quads were sore. I sat down for 15mins before I felt comfortable enough to penguin-walked to collect my post race food. Found a spot next to the Toronto sign where I sat and reflected on the entire event...and also noticed that most people brought an extra pair of shoe or sandal which I absolutely did not know about was a race thing to do smh. What made it worse was that my childhood friend who came down to support me said \"let's go to a cafe on Baldwin St to celebrate!\" I loved that idea but definitely not the long walk there in my running shoes.... She did say she can piggyback me...let's just say for a very quick moment I wanted to see if she could actually handle the 148lb of me on her back lol. We had a hearty pasta and dessert at Light Cafe (I recommend wholeheartedly; quality food with good price) and I regale her my entire running experience to her and we talked extensively about how one day, we will travel to a country and run a marathon together lol.  \n\n#### Reflection\n* I should have ran a bit more conservatively in the beginning of the race and save the energy. \n* Hydrating strategy was almost on-point. At no point during the race I felt I was thirsty\n* Gel strategy was great too. I did have a caffeine gel with me; not sure if that would have helped me get over that last 3K\n* My training should have included interval sessions; I had sufficient volume but not enough quality runs\n\n#### Future Plans\nMy plan is to complete a half-ironman in 2025 that's scheduled in July 6th...but marathon goal is still my penultimate objective, especially getting to the 3hr mark. I'm aiming for 3:30:00 in my next race though at this time, i'm not sure which marathon I should compete in. I did sign up for Berlin 2025 and Chicago 2025 but I'm not holding my breath in getting either of them (i'm already 0/3 on the draw). I think maybe I would try another race outside of Ontario scheduled in the Fall. For now, my 2024 season is completed with no more races or events planned because I'm broke and racing is expensive. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "**Event**: [Detroit Free Press Marathon](https://www.freepmarathon.com/).\n\n**Date**: 20th October 2024.\n\n**Location**: Detroit, MI and Windsor, ON.\n\n**Time**: 3:29:XX.\n\n**Background**:\n\nI (male aged 25-29) casually ran cross country and track in high school and then sporadically ran on the treadmill for the following few years. My real running journey began in late summer of 2021 when a friend of mine convinced me to sign up for the local half-marathon. With three months to train from zero to 13.1 miles, I ran without a training plan, fell pretty in love with the sport, and achieved on the November race day a time of sub 2 hours on the hilly course. While I was very pleased with my performance, I (likely due to improper footwear and illogical training techniques) felt burnt out and completely stopped running for the next 8 months.\n\nThen August 2022 rolled around and the cycle repeated - zero to HM followed by no more running. In August of 2023 the cycle began again but this time I decided to follow Hal Higdon's intermediate half-marathon training plan and get a more cushioned pair of shoes. The results were staggeringly different this time around. I achieved a final result of 1:42:XX and, once the race was over, felt hungry for more running rather than fizzled out.\n\nNot too long after my third HM, I signed up for the May 2024 Pittsburgh Marathon. I elected to follow Hal Higdon's intermediate marathon training plan for the 4 month training block. After some minor setbacks involving blisters in the first few weeks, I stuck to the plan religiously and had plenty of fun while doing so. Heading into the race, my goal time was sub 3:45:00.\n\nI completely underestimated the beast that is the marathon distance. A combination of (1) humid and rainy weather, (2) a massive hill at mile 14, (3) poor choice of shoes (sorry On Cloudmonsters), and (4) insufficient nutrition (I only consumed 2 puree fruit pouches and a few electrolyte drinks from the fluid stations) led to bonk at mile 17! Prior to this I was on pace for my goal time, but hitting the wall forced me to run walk the remaining 9 miles. I finished with a time of 3:53:XX and, while proud that I could accomplish the marathon,  frankly was a bit disappointed with the result. I knew I wanted to try this again and I pretty much immediately set my sights on the October 2024 Detroit Marathon.\n\n**Training**:\n\nMy second marathon training block began on the first of July 2024. This time around I used Hanson's advanced marathon plan and I set myself a goal time of sub 3:30:00. I had to skip the first two weeks because I miscalculated when I should start and I missed 9 days of training in the beginning of August due to vacation. Other than these instances, I never missed a workout and I occasionally added few easy miles. During this time I also began experimenting with shoes more seriously and I found that my flat feet quite like the brands Altra and Karhu. It was a bit of a learning curve with the Altras as I was not used to the low drop at first. But the strength improvements made in my feet and calves and the substantial room in my toe box were much appreciated.\n\nWhile I didn't dislike Higdon's plans while doing it, I found Hanson's plan to be more enjoyable and better suited to improving my fitness. Most of the days of the week are medium-long easy paced runs and this built up my aerobic base without injury or mental fatigue. Two days of the week are speedwork (intervals on Tuesdays and a marathon pace run on Thursday) and these are separated by a rest/cross-training day (on which I either biked or swam). The fact that the Sunday long run Hanson's plan tops out at just 16 miles was also a positive in my opinion as I felt the quicker recovery time led to a more productive cycle.\n\nI typically did my easy and long runs at a 8:50 - 9:30 min/mi pace, my later Tuesday interval workouts at a 7:00 -- 7:40 min/mi pace, and my Thursday marathon goal pace runs at 7:50 min/mi. Coming into the October race, I felt super prepared - much more than I did for my first marathon.\n\n**Gear**:\n\nMy shoes were the Altra Experience Flow. My on-person nutrition was 6 Hüma Gels.\n\n**Race Experience**:\n\nI would highly recommend the Detroit marathon! The course is very scenic, crosses the US-Canada border, is relatively flat, and is well-staffed with fluid and nutrition stations. The crowds were amazing and super supportive. The race starts at 7:00 am which is about 50 min before sunrise. While crossing the Ambassador Bridge at about mile 2.5, we were treated to beautiful views of Michigan and Ontario. The only (extremely minor) complaint I have about the course is the underwater tunnel crossing back into Detroit from Windsor gets quite warm (and I lost GPS signal here).\n\nPre-race I had some oatmeal, waffles, water, and a coffee. I was determined not to bonk this marathon and so I made a plan to consume a gel at miles 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 23, have either water or Gatorade at every fluid station I came across, and maintain a steady but somewhat conservative pace of 8:00 min/mi in the first 14 miles.\n\nI ran the first three miles at an 8:05 min/mi pace and then stepped it up to a 7:55 min/mi average until mile 14 when I had to take a 20 second porta-potty break. After that I held a steady 7:50 min/mi until mile 22. I was super excited about how good I was feeling - I had no pains and seemed to have evaded the wall with my frequent gel consumption. But then the marathon distance started to fight back: My legs began to fatigue and my heartrate increased from 167 avg to 177 avg. Consequentially, my pace dropped to 8:02 min/mi and my high spirits began drift away (I also decided to skip consuming my final gel at mile 23 as I wasn't sure if I could handle another).\n\nI tried my best to stay positive, keep a smile on my face, take energy from the crowds, and remind myself that it is a privilege to be out here running. This worked and by mile 25 I dropped my pace down to 7:45 min/mi. This was followed by a \"sprint\" to the finish for the last fifth of a mile. I was very pleased to have achieved my goal time by just a few seconds. This was overall a wonderful and humbling experience.\n\n**Post Race**:\n\nMy quads and ankles got the lion's share of the soreness and I am very thankful to not have an injury, shin pain, or knee pain. The day after race day I went for a 45 min slow walk in the woods and today (two-days post race) I took a 30 min slow jog to get the blood flowing and the recovery moving along. My next event is my local half-marathon (mentioned at the beginning of this post) in slightly less than 3 weeks."

Hence, do you have any recommendations for the perfect hybrid shoe? One with a not-too-big heel drop that I can comfortably walk all day with, but also do my morning run in, and also with some profile to go for the occasional hike/off-road exploration? I thought those were the HOKA Transport for me but while they are perfect for walking, I don't find them very comfortable running in. \n\nMaybe I'm asking for the impossible, but it would be great to hear your thoughts!"

I also completed the Vancouver Marathon earlier this year. My PB between races was less than a minute, and I wasn’t happy with how I did in Vancouver, but there were a few obvious issues with my build to that race:\n\n* I didn’t have a lot of mileage. I followed Garmin’s auto-suggestions which would ease up workouts when I didn’t sleep enough, and I didn't have an actual plan.\n* I didn’t taper well, so I was sore going into the race. That being said, a shakeout run could have been a good idea after flying across the country a few days before.\n* My nutrition strategy was bad. I was resistant to the idea of taking too many gels, and I didn’t practice with any either. I ate whole foods during the race, and didn’t take in enough carbs. I also didn’t really carb load, plus I had stomach issues because of something I had eaten the night before.\n\nThis time around, I didn’t have a plan for the fall, but knew I was going to do a full marathon. I entertained the idea of joining a paid run club because I wanted to build camaraderie with teammates who were seriously pursuing similar goals to me. There were a few I considered, but ended up being accepted from a waitlist into a popular one in my city, so I joined them about a month and some change into their build for a fall marathon. I also have Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease, both which affect my health and ability to train and race. Figure it’s worth mentioning explicitly now to contextualize talking about taking insulin later on.\n\nThe run club creates a training plan for you based on a fall race and takes into account what your pace zones are based on recent race results. This was a good change for me because over the last year I focused too much on staying within heart rate zones estimated by Garmin, but this time around I did workouts based on feel and pace and only looked at heart rate data after the fact.\n\nBecause I was meeting a lot of people doing TCS this year, I signed up again instead of doing a new race this season because I wanted to race with others. Also, folks may be happy to hear that I am now thinking in kilometers instead of just miles 😛.\n\nThe run club did two workouts a week and one long run. Sometimes the long run was also one of the workout runs. Under the plan I was hitting way higher mileage than I ever have since high school, but I was able to handle it fine. Before I joined the club, my goal was to run a marathon in under 3:20. I felt I was in 3:15 shape for Vancouver and had a bad race. Still, I wanted to have a conservative goal. After training with the club for a few weeks, I felt strong and updated my goal to go under 3:10. After I did a few tune-up races, I updated my goal to be under 3:05. In the past month folks were encouraging me to go sub-3, but I knew I didn’t want to extend that far, and the forecast for the race was looking pretty warm as well.\n\nI would do strength training once or twice a week. Once a week at a class offered by my company that was full-body, and otherwise I would occasionally do my own shorter routines. In the beginning of training with the club, I did have some issues being very sore after my strength workouts or their intense workouts, but I realized that eating more carbs and protein made a very noticeable difference in recovering a lot quicker. I bought protein powder with cane sugar instead of artificial sweetener, upped my carb intake and tried to compensate by taking more insulin with a lot of lead-time.\n\nI bought a handheld bottle and used that for a lot of my training. Up until a week before the race, I intended to carry it with me for the race, filled with honey and electrolyte water, and I planned to refill it at one or two water stations instead of stopping at other water stations. My reason for opting not to carry it with me despite it being warm on race day was because of how much easier it was to run without it on some of the training runs, and because of how one of my tune-up races went.\n\nI hit many PRs during my training block. Even if the race hadn’t gone well for me, I was happy with how much I had improved in the block and the friends I’ve made as part of it. First, I hadn’t run a 5K in under 20 minutes in over a decade. I did a parkrun at the end of August, wearing my old training shoes, and intending to hold back to save energy for the rest of the day. I intended to get under 20, but ended up getting 19:18. \n\nThe following weekend, I was signed up for a 10K that I did as a tune-up last year. I went into it with a fair bit of lower back pain and poor sleep, so I had very low expectations. I had run 40:59 in a hot race back in June that didn’t go that well for me. I went in expecting not to even get a PB. I surprised myself by running a 39:02 and having a decent amount left in the tank. I actually almost caught up to the first woman to finish the race in my kick at the end and thankfully held off to avoid ruining her ribbon moment. After doing that, I updated my pace zones and marathon expectations. My goal marathon pace at this point was 4:20/km.\n\nMy last tune-up was the inaugural Oakville 21.1k. I would say it was overall a fun race, but I had qualms over the fact that I did not have any public transit options available to me to make the race, and it was a fairly hot and humid day. Otherwise, the race had great vibes, free photos (that took forever to skim through, but I can’t complain since it was free), and Gatorade instead of Nuun, which means more accessible carbs. Runalyze and Garmin were telling me I could run a half in 1:26, but I wanted to run it mostly at marathon pace so that I could get a feel for that and also avoid burning myself out 3 weeks before my goal race. It was also my first time racing with my handheld bottle. I went out with the intention to run at 4:20/km until the last half or last 5K. That’s about what I did for the first 5K, but after my friend dropped the pace because of the humidity, I got a bit carried away and ran the next 10K at 4:15 pace, and kicked for the last 5K. I was really pushing myself for the last 5K and felt annoyed that I wasn’t going to go sub-90 despite putting in so much effort, but kept convincing myself that the smart thing to do was to be happy with a 1:32. Imagine my shock when I sprinted the last 100 meters and stopped my watch at exactly 1:30:00, and found out my chip time was 4 seconds under 1:30 🤯. I felt very tired, and my shoulder was really hurting from carrying my water bottle in the last several kms. This is what got me to realize that carrying it when going all-out in a race was a mistake. I got a complimentary massage after the race, which was great, but then I had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes to get on a shuttle to the train station where I had a few minutes to catch a train back to Toronto, which I thankfully caught. \n\nWith my training plan, I had a three week taper, which is the longest taper I’ve ever done. I definitely understand what people mean when they talk about tapering aches and excess energy. The intensity of the workouts were going down and the easy runs were getting shorter. The weather was also getting cooler, which made the runs feel easy, but the forecast for this race was warm. Kind of annoying because it obviously affects my time, but I thankfully did a fair bit of running in the heat over the summer. I’m also not a large guy (125 lbs) so I am probably a lot less affected by heat than others.\n\nThe week of the race, I did one of my easy runs and felt a sharp pain in the arch of my left foot, which scared me. I think it may have been because I wore a pair of shoes without my custom orthotics two days in a row with a lot of walking. I need to work on arch-strengthening exercises over the winter. Thankfully this pain went away the next day, and I had a physiotherapist take a look at it to help loosen it up along with my glutes and adductors.\n\n### Pre-race\n\nI did a lot more carbo-loading than I’d ever done before. This was honestly challenging as a diabetic, because sugar spikes suck pretty bad. I reduced the protein and vegetables in my meals, had more rice and gluten free toast, and had a few bagels throughout the day along with some gluten free cereal with basic and simple ingredients. I tried to take a lot of insulin in advance of eating carbs, and for the most part I was thankfully able to avoid too many blood glucose spikes. I also avoided caffeine entirely the week before the race. I had a few electrolyte drinks, lots of water, and coconut water for the extra minerals.\n\nThe morning of, I woke up at 5am. I had leftover buckwheat porridge: this was soaked buckwheat groats with some spices and cocoa powder mixed into an instant pot with uncooked soy milk (soaked soy beans blended with water, bananas, and vanilla extract), and cooked in the porridge setting for 9 minutes. When eating, I added honey, chocolate chips, shredded coconut, and cold brew coffee. Great stuff. I also had a can of coconut water with this.\n\nIt was important for me to eat early not only to get everything out of my system before heading out, but because I wanted to avoid having any active insulin on-board during the race. Generally, when you take insulin, it’s active in your body for 3 hours, so exercising can cause that insulin to bring your sugar levels low. I had an incident a month ago where I fainted at the beginning of a long run because of low blood sugar. I was thankfully around people and the person next to me stopped me from falling down, but the whole incident had me spooked. I’ve since done more research on how other Type 1 Diabetics handle competitively running with the disease.\n\nMy race morning was a bit busy. The start time was at 8am. I walked to my office, which is a few blocks away from the start, to drop off my clothes and toiletries; I planned to shower at the office after the race. I took advantage and used the washroom and sip some water while there. I then crossed the start corral to make it for my run club’s group photo at 7:15. Then I crossed the corral again to go back to the office to use the washroom again, and gather folks from my company who were also running for a group photo. At this point it was 7:45 so I started my warm up routine and did some strides before heading to my corral. At this point my blood sugar was a bit high, but I resisted the urge to take a correction dose of insulin. I also set up exercise mode and a separate pump profile for running. I had a gluten free Honey Stinger waffle and figured my sugar will go low when I start the race.\n\nMy gear:\n\n* Lululemon SenseKnit Half tights with two side pockets: one for my phone, another for my insulin pump\n* 3” Brooks Sherpa shorts over that: partially for some extra storage for chocolate caffeine candies that I stole from the office and a few extra gels, and also for modesty because the Lulu half tights are very revealing and I’ve gotten lots of comments on them before 😅\n* Cheap race belt from Decathlon that holds the bib and has slots for 6 gels (highly recommend)\n* Saucony Endorphin Pro 3s: this is my third marathon in them and may be my last, as I am thinking of downgrading them to be a secondary race and long workout run shoe.\n* Nutrition\n  * Two Huma+ gels (with extra electrolytes. One of them was caffeinated)\n  * Three Maurten 100 gels (one uneaten)\n  * One Maurten 160 gel (uneaten)\n  * Several chocolate caffeine candies (ate one)\n  * Two Brita Maple Syrup gels (ate the one with himalayan pink salt, didn’t eat the ginger-flavoured one)\nAwesome source of fuel, but terrible for running because of how runny maple syrup is. It gets all over your hands and will make them sticky. \n\n### Race\n\nIn one of my last training runs, one of the leaders of the run club told us about how he kept track of his race pace in 5K intervals rather than per kilometer. He explained how this accounted for different elevations within each 5K split, which made a lot of sense to me. He also set up his auto-lap settings to lap at 5.05 kilometers to account for weaving and GPS inaccuracies. I liked the idea so I set up auto-lap at 3.2 miles and intended to manually lap the splits. I aimed for 21:40/5K, and I got familiar with each km split during the race (4:20, 8:40, 13:00, 17:20, and 21:40).\n\nThe night before and morning of the race, I was feeling stiffness around my right adductor and quad, and my knee felt awkward. I tried to convince myself that a warm-up would fix the issue, but in my shakeout run the day before, I did some pick-ups and could feel blood rushing to that knee. Thankfully there was no pain, but it made me a bit nervous.\n\nOne thing that was annoying was that my Garmin’s Dexcom data field didn’t work for the entire race. This means I had to pull my insulin pump out of the pocket every time I wanted to check what my blood sugar was.\n\n#### 0-5K\n\nI was pretty close to the front, which is surprising because I wasn’t trying to be and didn’t push my way forward at all. I did see the 3:10 pacer behind me so I knew I was in the right area.\n\nI started off a bit hot. I intended to go a bit slow up the hill until Bloor Street, but I was at or just below 4:20 pace. I had electrolytes at the first aid station. I was worried about the fact that I didn’t feel cold at all before starting so I wanted to get whatever electrolytes I could early on. I crossed the cheer station with my friends fairly early on (I think around 3km in); they were at The Runners Shop, all volunteers wore orange shirts, there was a band playing, and there was a woman on stilts giving runners high fives.\n\nWe turned onto Bathurst which was a long downhill. I felt a bit awkward going down here again, but I tried my best to keep my strides short and avoid over-exerting myself on the downhill. One of the folks who I trained with over the past month passed by me somewhere south of Dundas. He had previously encouraged me to go for sub-3, and he kept on going ahead, so I figured he was going for it. I was sticking to my 4:20 goal pace, and my ankles were already feeling sore.\n\n#### 5-10K\n\nWe crossed my run club’s cheer station where they were giving out high fives and some faces who I trained with cheered me on. Turning onto Fort York Blvd, a member of my run club who wasn’t up at the cheer station but hanging out by himself on the sidewalk called out my name, which felt nice. I took one of my Maurten 100s out of my race belt and held onto it. I was a bit worried about my sugar going low. I checked my blood sugar level on my pump and it looked like it was still a bit high, but started going down. I took the gel around the 8km mark and held onto the wrapper until the next aid station. Before then, one of my run club’s coaches passed me, asked how I was doing, and gave me a fist bump. I was still under 4:20/km pace at the end of this split, but wasn’t going to worry about time if I felt like I was working decently hard.\n\n#### 10-15K\n\nI was still feeling strong, but a bit worried about my sugar and the heat. We weren’t facing the sun yet, but I may have felt some sweat coming on. When I fainted a few weeks ago, it was preceded by a lot of sweat, which is common when I become severely hypoglycemic. I already had a gel around 8km, so I decided to have one of the caffeine chocolate candies just before the 12K marker, where there was an aid station to toss the wrapper. I was alternating between water and electrolytes at each of the aid stations, though I may have gotten electrolytes a few extra times. The turnaround at 12.5km was brutal because we started facing the sun. I flipped my hat and carried on, but I could feel myself starting to sweat a bit more, so I slowed down a bit in order to avoid over-doing it in the first half. I did a 10k in June on this exact course and it was very hot that day as well. I thought to myself that this wasn’t as hot as that day, but I have a lot more to do, and there wouldn’t be a cooldown station on this course like there was then.\n\nIt was around here where I started having wardrobe malfunctions in the race last year. I felt great knowing I didn’t make the same dumb mistakes as last year and overall felt good about how much stronger I am now than I was back then. \n\n#### 15-20K\n\nWe passed by the huge cheer station at Coronation Park. This was a congregation of so many run clubs: Toronto Harriers, QSW Run Crew, Not A Run Club, Curre Club, MVM, and probably others I’m not remembering. Great energy from the folks here. Around the 17K marker is where I think I had a Huma+ gel. One of my work friends was walking out of his building onto the street right as I was passing by. It was more quiet than the cheer stations we just passed, so it was hard for us to miss each other. He didn’t have time to take out his nice camera but managed to snap a picture on his phone.\n\nThe aid station at 18K was awesome. The volunteer who was holding a megaphone instructing runners that electrolytes came before water knew me, so she called my name as I was passing through. Right after the aid station was Kardia’s cheer station where the folks are dressed as construction workers and had fun signs. We then went uphill on the ramp where they had a free yoga session before the race. We were approaching the halfway point and I still felt strong even after going up the hill. The parkdale runners cheer station was very loud, admittedly to the point that it was a bit too much and I had to cover my ears as I was passing. The distance between Simcoe and Bay had never felt so long.\n\n#### 20-25K\n\nI didn’t follow the tangent when turning onto Bay because I was worried I would miss a friend who told me he would be there around 20K (turns out he was running a bit late that morning, but he will appear later). Turning up on Bay St always makes me feel strong for some reason even though my pace slows down. I will sometimes bike up this street when commuting to work and it’s always frustrating because of how frequently cars illegally stop in the bike lane for pick-up/drop-off, so it felt nice to be able to go up Bay without any cars.\n\nI felt a HUGE surge of energy passing through the Culture Athletics cheer station with all of the cheers coming from the crowd. Unfortunately, the full course turns right onto Wellington and the second half of the course is much harder than the first. Decent cheer and aid station at Berczy Park, and we went through the St Lawrence neighborhood before we turned into the Canary District. I believe I had another Maurten gel before going down into the Bayview bike lane. \n\nI have mixed feelings about this section. I understand why folks find it boring, but I spend a lot of time biking in the area and the familiarity was good for me. On top of that, it’s a good opportunity to see folks ahead of and behind you. On the way north, I saw the member of my run club going for sub-3 whose name I yelled out (they didn’t hear me; he said after that he had music blasting). Not too far behind him, I saw another member who I remembered was also going for sub-3. After turning around, I saw the 3:10 pacers behind me. I then saw a member of my run club who was running her first marathon, so I shouted her name and she yelled back. At the aid station here, I dropped a bit of Nuun onto my foot and could feel my toe had gotten a bit wet. Slightly concerning, but I figured it was probably fine; I was wearing decently thick socks, I put petroleum jelly on my feet before the race, and it was pretty hot out.\n\n#### 25-30K\n\nThis is probably the second-worst part of the race. Going up and down Eastern Avenue into an industrial area with lots of construction, and then turning down onto Lakeshore East where you are at the mercy of the sun is tough. At least in this section, we had some tailwind. I tried picking up the pace a bit and tried sticking to the right to get whatever shade I could. I had another Huma+ gel around the 29K marker I believe.\n\nI can’t think of anything memorable happening in this section of the race. I just kept pushing forward to match the folks around me. There was a guy in a neon yellow shirt who I ran next to for a long stretch in the first half of the race who was still around me, and he was chatting with some others later. I’d be seeing him later.\n\n#### 30-35K\n\nI did the mental math for how many miles 30K was. I do recall doing 30K training runs with my run club and knowing it was somewhere around 18.5 miles. I’ve seen some folks say that 30K is their wall, and others say it’s 32K. I felt some chest tightness (I didn’t feel like it was heart pain so I wasn’t concerned; I just exaggerated my exhales and tried to relax my posture to loosen up my diaphragm and intercostal muscles), and my ankles had been hurting since the beginning, but I still felt strong, so I wasn’t worried about the wall. I just focused on eating my gels before I felt like they were necessary and taking in electrolytes. The uphill approaching Queen Street East was a bit tough, but I knew I was getting close to the last 10K. The section on QSE felt longer than it looks on a map, but it was really just over 2k. I waved to a coach who had already turned around, saw the sub-3 attempters, and kept going till I hit the turnaround.\n\nI sped up after 33K. There were less than 10k left and there were officially no more turnarounds left in the race. I started to see people fall to the side to stretch, so I tried to be mindful not to push too hard; there was still a lot of race left. I don’t remember exactly what happened, but I think my right glute (my arch-nemesis) started feeling a little bit like cement, so I slowed down a bit once again just to make sure I could still finish strong.\n\nPassing by the GU station was a bit frustrating. Volunteers would be holding out single gels and the way some of the runners would be aggressively snatching gels out of these volunteers hands was annoying. I saw a few runners bypass the volunteers and grab multiple GUs from the tables.\n\n#### 35-40K\n\nYellow shirt and I ran side-by-side, matching each other’s strides. This part of the race was fairly empty, so I was glad to have someone else to run with, but he unfortunately dropped his earphones and had to turn back to get that sorted. I spent a lot of this section alone, and it was probably the second-hardest part of the run for me. I felt like I was pushing my pace hard and wanted to go faster than 4:20/km, but my watch was telling me that I was a fair bit slower than that. The headwind was brutal and there was no protection against it. It was clear that the occasional person I would pass was struggling. One person was able to kick harder and blast past me. I had my Brita gel with Himalayan pink salt, which tasted good but my hands would be sticky for the remainder of the race.\n\nI got a bit of a break from the wind when turning North on Carlaw Avenue where I got to run uphill before turning onto Eastern and dealing with the wind again. The uphill section at 39K was tough, but I didn’t find it too bad. I saw a few people cramp around me, but I tried kicking again. I got a few hundred meters, but as I reached the end of the downhill ramp, my left hamstring started cramping on me. Thankfully, it wasn’t bad enough for me to have to stop, but I had to be really mindful of my strides, and I tried rubbing the hamstring to loosen it as well. I had Nuun at the 40K mark.\n\n#### 40K-Finish\n\nFinal stretch. I sucked at math at this point, so I switched to total time, and saw that I was somewhere around 2:55 at this point. No point in taking any more gels since they wouldn’t be able to help within a 2.2km timeframe. I knew that even if I slowed down a bit, I should be able to hit 3:05. I tried kicking as much as I could, but was limited. My hamstring started loosening up when I got back to Wellington so I tried kicking, but it was a narrow path with streetcar tracks. \n\nI got ready to turn north, but then got frustrated because I forgot that the turn was at Bay, not Yonge. It’s just one more block, no big deal. I saw my friend before the turn, so I waved and gave him a high five and started kicking a bit more before making the turn.\n\nIn my head, I figured at this part I could just kick and be done. It’s such a small distance, right? I never realized how long Wellington to Queen was until now. The incline really did make a big difference as well. The crowd support was great, though. My hamstring started cramping up again. I knew if I stopped I wouldn’t be able to start again, so I started striding awkwardly; my left leg stayed stiff while my right leg was bending normally. I only had to do this for a few seconds before I was able to run normally again. \n\nAfter what felt like another several minutes, I was finally at Queen Street, and I kicked as hard as I could. This year, I didn’t miss my corral, and I started near the front, so the time I saw on the clock was close to my chip time. I crossed under 3:05 and could finally stop. \n\n### Post-race\n\nI heard someone call my name right after I finished but didn’t know where it was coming from. I looked for my partner and friends to see if anyone came to watch, but didn’t see anyone. I kept hearing a man call my name, though. Eventually, I realized I had to look down because it was my run club mate who went for sub-3 sitting on the curb. We fist-bumped each other; we both left it all out there. It turns out he got 3:00:50, so very close to 3. I was shocked to hear that he didn’t take any nutrition during the race other than a GU before starting; he said he could not mentally convince himself to take anything as he was focused on running. Crazy stuff! We talked about how I was smart about how I took my fuel, which made me feel good about how I ran the race. It’s unfortunate how warm it was, but it is what it is.\n\nWe both hobbled over to our medals and to get water and Nuun. I took an extra cup of water. I took a ginger Gravol, not because I needed it, but just in case I would start to feel nauseous soon. I skipped the photo line because I just wanted to get out of the chute and get my massage. I found my partner and her friend, and she gave me a bouquet of flowers, which was a surprise. Before the race, she got anxious when I told her I would be aiming for sub-3:05; she thought I was going for sub-3:30. She was worried that I would push myself too hard and make myself sick, and I could tell it was upsetting. I smiled and pointed at her and playfully said “haters said I couldn’t do it 😏.” I felt fine stomach-wise; just pretty sore.\n\nIt took a while to find the food line because of how crowded it was. Apparently this was the biggest Canadian marathon ever. From everything I’ve seen there were so many runners doing the half, I eventually found the line after doing a loop around Nathan Phillips Square. I unfortunately didn’t have time to do bag check in the morning, so my recovery sandals were in my office. I didn’t want to go to my office yet, though, because I wanted to get my massage before taking a shower. I hobbled down to Bay and Wellington for the [Recovery Zone](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/toronto-waterfront-marathon-cheer-station-recovery-zone-tickets-1039370744877). There was not much of a wait at all to get a massage. The woman who worked on me did a great job at softening the cement that was my right glute before digging into my left hamstring. After my massage, I felt like it was a lot easier to move. I crossed Bay Street to get my commemorative Finisher’s scarf and get portraits taken. I’m looking forward to seeing them! I then went back to the Recovery Zone where I was allowed to take off my shoes and put on Normatec Compression Boots for 15 minutes. This felt extremely refreshing. After I was done here, I didn’t want to put my race shoes back on, so I walked with my socks back up to Richmond where my office is so I could take a shower and change before going out for lunch and dessert.\n\n#### Positives\n\n* Cheer stations and overall crowd support. The energy was felt. Even in some of the more remote sections, there would be at least one lone spectator yelling at us to keep going.\n  * The Cheer Station + Recovery Zone put together by Culture Athletics was awesome. It was loud, but not overwhelmingly so like it was last year, the announcer was hype, and that’s a crucial part of the race. The recovery zone helped me move around like a normal person for the rest of the day. I got another 12k steps walking around the city for lunch and dessert before walking home.\n* Most of the aid stations were good. Liquid would only be filled up halfway most of the time so there wasn’t much spillage. At the aid stations where the cups were filled up, I had to slow down a lot more and even then spilled a bit.\n* Being in a run club. Having others to be motivated with, cheer each other on, and be inspired by is good. On race day itself, wearing the club’s singlet and having so many spectators call out to me because of that made me feel very supported.\n\n#### Negatives\n* I wasn’t affected by this, but the TTC needs to run earlier, GO needs to run earlier and more often in general, and Bikeshare should offer concierge service for an event of this scale.\n  * Also, this is a tangent, but I was really sad to see one of my favourite gluten free bakeries in the city (Almond Butterfly) post a story complaining to the mayor and city about road closures for the marathon stopping people from arriving at their business via car. So many people are coming out for this event, many of whom may need gluten free food. Sad to see.\n* The stretch on Lakeshore East really is a dull part of the course.\n\n#### Future Plans\n\nI want to go sub-3 next year! I’m not sure if I’ll do a full in the Spring again, or focus on half marathons and trail races instead before doing one full in the fall. I would love to get to do Chicago next year as my 10th marathon after doing it as my 1st one over a decade ago, and going sub-3 there. Whether or not that happens is up to RNGesus. I will also find two folks to sign up for the Berlin lottery for as a team.\n\nI have a few local races I’m signed up for as secondary races in the meantime:\n\n* Fat Ass Trail Race (6 hour category)\n* Blacktoe Holiday 10k in December\n* Chilly Half in Burlington in March\n* Around the Bay 30k in Hamilton in March\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "I wanted to do a write up about this half marathon because I couldn't find any first hand experiences before I went and ran it!\n\n* Name: John Wayne Grit Series: Lone Pine Half Marathon (fundraiser for the John Wayne Cancer Foundation)\n* Date: October 19, 2024\n* Distance: \\~12.5 (the distance for this run was not quite 13.1)\n* Location: Alabama Hills in Lone Pine, CA\n* Elevation: \\~4500' to 5100'\n* Website: [https://johnwayne.org/pages/lonepine](https://johnwayne.org/pages/lonepine)\n* Time: 3:01\n* Photos: [https://imgur.com/a/Tc1irTr](https://imgur.com/a/Tc1irTr)\n\n**Terrain Description:**\n\nMost of the race was dirt/fire road with sections being very sandy and 2 miles of what I would call 'single track'.  Not quite a true trail run, but technical in that there were a lot of loose first sized rocks that were just ready to trip you up.\n\n**Weather Description:**\n\nLone Pine seems to be highs in the mid-70s around this time, but we got a colder and windier day.  Winds were a constant 15 to 20 miles an hour with about 60% being a headwind.  Start temperature was 48 degrees, and finish temperature was 65 degrees.\n\n**Race Support:**\n\nThere were 3 aid stations, with two being on an out and back path.  It was a cup-less event, so I ran with a water bottle waist pack and refilled once.  Snacks were the best!  They had Gu, but also M&Ms, Swedish Fish, and other miscellaneous candy, which I've never seen on a run before.  A pocketful of Swedish Fish is a surprisingly good race snack.  There were no 'race bathrooms' but there were port-o-potties at the camp/hike areas at miles \\~ 2, 9, and 12.\n\n97 people participated in the half marathon and about 130 for the 10k.\n\n**Race Event and Organization:**\n\nThey had a get together at a local restaurant the night before and provided a meal and beer for a super reasonable price.  They had a post race meal and beer at the same place the afternoon after the run.  I and my friends attended both of these and it was super fun to meet the organizers and the other runners.  Since it's a smaller run in a small town, it really felt like we made friends for the weekend.\n\nPacket pickup was the morning of (which I wished was the day before so that I could have my bib ready), and there was no official bag check. But it's a pretty chill event, so we just threw our bag in the back of their U haul until the end.  Energy at the start/finish was great and they had Brewery X beer in coolers that you just grabbed as you wanted and they had some tequila and bourbon tasting as well.\n\nThere were shuttles to the start/finish.  This year had a hiccup with one of the buses not being available the morning of, so it was just one school bus and we started late because of waiting for the last drop off.\n\n**Race Experience:**\n\nI very much enjoyed the organization, the volunteers, and the runners.  Everyone was in a great mood so it made the experience very fun.  And it was gorgeous.  Just a beautiful landscape and so much fun to be in an area where they filmed so many movies.\n\n**Take-Away:**\n\nI thought I'd be fine at 4000' altitude, but I felt it as soon as I started and it slowed me down.  The sandy patches were also not my favorite.  I was a little jealous of those runners that brought their ankle gaiters, but it wasn't terrible.  I never felt the need to stop and empty my shoes.  The headwind for the first 60% of the race was also not cool, but I just slowed down and turtled it.  Run with more water than you think you need!  It's dry and with that just little bit of altitude you'll want it. 100% would do that one again, or others in the series, and would probably participate in the fundraising to maybe get more involved that way, as they seem to be a decent charitable organization.\n\nHope this helps that future person thinking about signing up and pushes them to do it!\n\n"

I had pretty high hopes I would most definitely be able to PR since my first marathon was in October 2023 and was a 4:19:51. I just didn't know how much I would be able to improve. I spent most of the winter preparing my base, with a nice ramp up in mileage from November-January. I had some issues with the wrong shoes and then developing shin splints that derailed some of that base building. I had to go back down to 4-day run weeks and only barely managing to get back to 5-days right before the training block thanks to PT and religiously following what she said.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Training\nBecause of the shin splints, I dialed back what training plan I was going to use from Hal Higdon's Advance 1 to Hal Higdon's Intermediate 2. That went out the door around week 1. The plan started too \"easy\" for me. Instead, I just drew a line from where I was to where I wanted to be and filled in the runs and tried to hit a weekly mileage and long run target. My weeks fell into a pretty predictable pattern \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Monday - \"mid\"-week long run that capped off with a 3-mile group run (6-14 miles) \n* Tuesday - track workout including run commute there, warm up, and cool down (6-9 miles)\n* Wednesday - tempo group run (7-9 miles) \n* Thursday - rest \n* Friday - medium long run (started at 4 miles and ramped up to 10) \n* Saturday - long runs (16 - 22 miles, with the peaks of 2-20s and 1-22 and a step-backs every 3rd week) \n* Sunday - rest \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeekly Mileage \n\n| Week  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 (Race Week) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Mileage | 34 | 43 | 42 | 48 | 51 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 44 | 56 | 58 | 49 | 60 | 51 | 61 | 45 | 37 | 46 |\n\n&nbsp;\nI managed to peak about 3 times at about 59-61 miles with a rest week between each of them. Along with running, I did strength training 4-5 times a week aiming for: 2 push, 2 pull, and 1 leg day. \n&nbsp;\n\n\nI went with a 3 week taper and had the usual ups and downs and yo-yoed between strong doubts and brazen optimism. I was still nervous about what pace I want to do. My 43:36 10k race seemed to indicate I could go sub-3:30, but I hadn't run *any* miles at that pace! But I also knew I had a really solid training block and didn't want to waste that potential. Honestly, I still hadn't decided while I was standing in the starting corral. One of my club-mates even asked and I said \"I don't know yet...\"\n\n### Race\nOnce the gun went off, I decided to try and stick with the club-mate who was standing by me because she said she was aiming for 3:30. I bargained with myself that if I could stay with her for 20 miles at an 8:00ish pace then I would only need to do the last 6.2 miles in 1 hour to meet my top goal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe course itself was fairly flat, minor rolling hills that were actually pretty welcomed. The trees were changing so I got a little leaf peeping in. My only gripe is how narrow parts of the course were because some of the roads were still open. The route consisted of a 3 mile out, with a 10ish-mile loop twice, and then 3 miles to the finish line. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Miles 1-13\nWent out aiming for about an 8:00 minute pace, which we (myself and two of my club-mates) were able to handle pretty well. I could tell it was the right call because 8:00 minutes seems way too slow for what my body wanted. It was pretty chilly at the start at 41 degrees, but it felt absolutely amazing once I was warmed up. Honestly, the miles were flying by. The three of us chit-chatted a little, but mostly just silently kept pushing each other to stick together. I was getting pretty excited coming into the half-way point because at our current pace I would be near or at my previous half-marathon PR. How cool would that be to PR a half in the middle of a marathon! Alas, we wound up about 30 seconds off that record.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Miles 13-20 \nI was definitely getting nervous because this was around the time I started hurting during my previous marathon, so I was bracing myself for *something*. That *something* never really came during this period. I was doing well, keeping up with my gel consumption and getting water every other water stop (so about every ~4 miles). I had Skratch in a bottle around my waste that I would alternate, but I was still feeling oddly great for a marathon. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Miles 20-23 \nOur little trio was still together at this point, and we were slowly gaining on the 3:30 group. They took off at the start of the race, but were never out of vision. If we kept the pace up, we probably would converge with them right at the end of the race. My legs had a different opinion, and just started going. In retrospect, it was only a slight increase in pace but boy did it feel like an extra effort. One of my companions stuck with me  while the other fell behind and wasn't quite able to ever catch back to us. We started really gaining on the 3:30 pace group and picking off stragglers that had fallen off.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Miles 23-26.2 \nMy plan was to catch up to the 3:30 group and rest for a while and decide if I wanted to push in the last mile or so. We got to them around mile 23. I started chatting with the pacer about what they were planning to end at (~3:28) and telling her about our efforts to chase them down most of the race. She says \"You sure are talking a lot\" and I felt bad and said \"Sorry, I'll stop talking\". Then she goes \"No, what I mean is you sure are talking a lot for someone who only has 3 miles left of a marathon which means you have extra energy, so go on!\". After a little more encouragement and cheering from her, I decided to speed up and catch up with my running buddy who had already begun dropping me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI could feel every step of the last three miles and probably checked my watch no less than 10 times every mile. I got angry at the last .2 miles because there felt like there were twenty turns and none of them was to the finish line. Where was the finish line??? The weather had climbed to low 60s at this point with no shade and my stomach was making me nauseous, but that sub 3:30 was within reach and I couldn't walk now. Finally, the finish! It was over and I almost cried because not only did I finish another marathon, but I absolutely smashed any expectations I had of myself.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Post-race\nThe post-race was a very joyous occasion for not only me, but for many of my club-mates who crossed the finish line with massive PRs. There was so much happiness swapping stories and accomplishments with everyone from the club. However, at some point I definitely laid in the grass and groaned \"I'm never running another marathon again\". My husband just responded with \"I'll give that about three hours before you change your mind\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe's not wrong, I'm so ready to start planning my next cycle (I just need to be able to walk without too much wobbling first)! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOverall, I loved this training cycle. It has cemented my love for long distances and taught me a lot about what a lot of hard work (and a lot of luck) looks like. I've grown into a wonderful support system within my local running club that gave me the excitement for running and the motivation to push myself week after week. I learned a lot more about \"race management\" in real time rather than reading endless reddit threads about it. \n\n\nThings I'll do differently next time: \n\n- More training miles at race pace, that would have alleviate a lot of the pre-race pace nervousness \n- Bump up to 6 runs a week because the mileage towards the end felt unsustainable with only running 5 days a week \n- Believe in myself more because I just proved I **can** do hard things\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "Now that Winter is quickly approaching (in the Northern Hemisphere, at least), it seems we are are getting more winter/cold weather posts which means it is time for the annual Winter Megathread.\n\n[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather#wiki_winter.2Fcold) the link for the cold weather info in our wiki.  I will add this post to that at a later date.  If you happen to be in the Southern Hemisphere and entering the season of the big fiery death ball in the sky, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather/) the link to the \"Running in the Heat\" section of the wiki .\n\n**Why should I run in the winter?**\n\n* Winter running makes you strong!\n\n* That person you really want to beat next year is out there training right now\n\n* Spring weather feels so much better when you’ve been training through the winter\n\n\n**Clothing**\n\nYou’re going to want materials that will keep you warm even when damp or wet. Think wool, fleece, and wicking synthetics. You’ll also want things to be breathable so you don’t get super sweaty (and even colder).  Layer up so you can adjust during your run.\n\nTrapped air is what keeps you warm and cozy in the winter. If your shoes are really tight with a couple pairs of socks on, or your gloves/mittens are too tight, you may have less trapped air and impair circulation, which will make you cold.\n\nHere’s an example of what works well for some in calm, dry conditions. Keep in mind wind or precipitation will make things colder, and that it’s always better to have an extra layer than to make do without.  This can also vary widely between people and how comfortable you want to be.  Use the table as a guide to layering suggestions factoring in how fast/slow you are running (for generating body heat) as well as how hot/cool natured you normally are.\n\n**Temp Range**|**Upper**|**Lower**|**Socks**|**Hands**|**Head**\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n30 to 40F (-1 to 5C)|Long-sleeve (LS) shirt|Shorts or light pants|regular socks|Light gloves|headband\n20 to 30F (-6 to -1C)|LS shirt + baselayer|Regular tights|1x midweight wool|Light gloves|headband\n10 to 20F (-12 to -6C)|LS Baselayer + wind vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs|2x midweight wool|Mittens|Hat + light gator\n0 to 10F (-18 to -12C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket or vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens|heavy hat, fleece balaclava, eye protection\n<0 F (<-18 C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens w/ gloves underneath|heavy hat x2, fleece balaclava, eye protection (glasses or goggles, if windy)\n\nHere are some useful links to some guides that can help you choose appropriate amount of clothing:\n\n[Fahrenheit Pictorial Guide](https://i.imgur.com/GKwoDUQ.jpg)\n\n[Celsius Pictorial Guide](https://i.imgur.com/KKbJgwl.jpg)\n\n[Dress My Run Website - Quick tool to show what to wear based on where you live and weather](http://dressmyrun.com/)\n\n* Click on \"Settings\" in the bottom right hand corner to adjust your personal temperature preference (warmer or cooler)\n\n**Footwear**\n\nRoad shoes are fine most of the time, unless you're running somewhere that consistently has snow or ice-covered sidewalks. If you have good socks, your feet should stay warm even if damp from melting snow. Think more carefully about your footwear if there’s snow or ice on the ground.\nOn fresh snow or packed, but still soft snow, trail shoes (something with a low to moderate lug) work very well.  [Turning an old pair of road shoes into Screw Shoes](https://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-shoe-screws) is an excellent idea for ice, thawed and refrozen snow, and heavily packed snow conditions – the screws do a great job providing a bit of extra traction.\n\nYou can also look into traction devices (like Yaktrax) when icy.\n\nWhen running, direction changes and stopping are the most likely times to slip and fall on snow or ice. Slow down and be cautious around corners and street crossings. As you run, make sure you’re landing with your feet underneath your center of mass – even if you do have a slippery step, keep your feet moving, and you can usually recover and avoid a fall.\n\n**Safety**\n\nIf you work during the day, chances are your morning or evening run will be dark. Get yourself a good headlamp (to see and be seen), and wear a reflective vest over your other clothing. Know that motorists may be less likely to expect you to be out running when it’s 15 degrees and snowing.\n\nIf it's really cold, make adjustments or plans to ensure you can stay safe during your run even if you turn an ankle or something else happens where you can't keep running to stay warm. Plan your route along safe warm zones (friend's house, grocery stores, etc.), and/or carry your cell phone (close to your body, so your battery doesn't die). If you for some reason can't run, you will quickly get very chilled.  [Here's](https://www.weather.gov/bou/windchill) a Windchill Safety chart from the National Weather Service to help determine when things might be too dangerous to run or if you do, to take extra safety precautions.\n\nStart your runs into the wind - this will be the coldest part - so that your finish your runs with a warmer tailwind. This can make a big difference - if you get sweaty during your run, and turn into a stiff breeze to finish, you're likely to get chilled as you're heading home.\n\nHere's a good post on [Running in snow tips..?](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/zj8zhw/running_in_snow_tips/)\n\n\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nEven when it’s cold out, you’ll want to be sure you’re hydrated before and during long runs. You’re probably sweating more than you might think, it will evaporate quickly in cold dry air. Have a method to keep fluids from freezing when it’s cold out, either by keeping fluids under a layer of clothing (vest or hydration pack), planning a route around accessible water, or figuring out a way to keep your handheld from freezing up.\n\nGels and other foods can freeze too – tuck these items into a glove or mitten a few minutes before you want to eat, to thaw them out and warm them up.\n\n###**The comments below will be divided into some broad categories to try and keep things organized.

        "Texto": "> *\"I can do hard things.\" —Ms. Rachel* \n\nAround 1pm on December 2, the messages started to roll in:\n\n>\"Yeah brother!!!! Hardrock!!!!\"\n\n>\"Waitlist for Hardrock! Yeah brother!! Hope you get in!!\"\n\n>\"7!!!!\"\n\nI had been selected seventh in the Men's Never waitlist for the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run. THE Hardrock. The big granddaddy of US mountain runs. My singular running goal for almost a decade. I had heard about Hardrock back when I started running in 2012, worked my way up to finishing a qualifying race in 2016, and started applying for the lottery immediately. I had been \"lucky\" to get selected so quickly.\n\nSeventh was an exciting but awkward spot on the waitlist. Low enough that I wasn't guaranteed to get into the run, but high enough that I would have to train. Hard.\n\nLike the name suggests, Hardrock is one of the most difficult 100 milers in the world. Starting in the old mining town of Silverton, the course makes a single massive loop through the heart of Colorado's rugged San Juan Mountains, crossing multiple 13,000 foot passes and summitting a 14er. The average elevation is over 11,000 feet. The run is an homage to the hard rock miners who built many of the trails and jeep roads to extract precious metals from these brutal, gorgeous mountains.\n\n##**Training**\n\n(This section is unlikely to be interesting to most people. You should probably skip it. The actual race report is down below.)\n\nMy training volume has been hit and miss over the years, but I was determined not to show up to Silverton unprepared. The only minor, teensy complication was that, for the first time in my life I would be balancing 100 miler training with fatherhood. Yes, it turns out that my first official race after the birth of my daughter Emily would also be the most personally meaningful race I had ever run. No pressure!\n\nOkay, there was a secondary complication if I'm being honest: How do you train for a race that you might not actually run? The answer to that ended up being straightforward. I would simply gaslight myself into believing that it was a 100 percent guarantee. And if I ended up not running it, I could deal with the emotional fallout later. What could go wrong?\n\nAs for the actual nuts and bolts of training, I no longer had the time for 8-10 hour meandering long runs every Saturday. I needed to be strategic. The first order of business was to lose some of my \"dad bod\" weight, which meant cutting out my morning bagel and evening beer(s) during the week. I dropped from 175ish pounds to about 160 before race day.\n\nI also adopted the unholy trinity of aging ultrarunners: stretching, strength training, and cross training. I despise every one of those things, but I could feel the benefits almost immediately in my runs, so I stuck with it. My hip bursitis, IT band pain, sciatica, and various other old-person ailments gradually improved even as I ramped up my mileage. I suppose I should have started doing all of this stuff years ago.\n\nInstead of making the long drive to the Catskills, Adirondacks, or Whites to find sustained climbs on the weekends, I spent my lunch breaks on an incline treadmill set to 20%, knocking out 3,000-5,000 foot workouts while watching Hardrock videos on YouTube. Saturday's long runs generally started around 4 or 5am so I could be back at home for Emily's breakfast. Occasionally I would run a second time during her morning nap or in the evening when she went to bed. I did manage to sneak away for my annual Everesting attempt in March and a Cactus to Clouds run in May, which both gave me confidence in my training.\n\nMy peak weeks were a respectable 60mi/20k', 61mi/20k', 46mi/20k'. By the time we got to Colorado, I had logged 350,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain in the past six months.\n\nNow I just had to get into the dang thing.\n\n##**The moment of truth... or is it?**\n\nWe landed in Denver still not knowing whether I was going to run Hardrock or not. I had gradually moved up to first on the waitlist, but time was running out. Flights, hotels, and a sprinter van had all been booked months in advance, and my crew/pacer dream team had made plans to travel out too. We collectively held our breaths waiting for some movement on the list.\n\nIn the meantime, Alex, Em, and I had some vacationing to do. My top priority was to get Emily to the summit of a 14er. I was halfway up Quandary Peak with a sleeping baby on my back when Alex stopped to answer a work email. I figured I'd take my phone off airplane mode to check my emails too, only to see a voicemail from an unknown number.\n\n>Voicemail: Hi Ryan. Dale Garland, Hardrock Endurance Run. When you get this message, if you would, please give me a call. Thanks!  \n>Alex: Call him back! Call him back right now!!\"\n\nI dialed back.\n\n>Me: Hi Dale, this is Ryan Thorpe returning your call.  \n>Dale: Hey, Ryan. Where are you right now?  \n>Me: I'm on the side of Quandary Peak.  \n>Dale: That seems like driving distance to Silverton.  \n>Me: That was the idea.  \n>Dale: Well, I have a bib with your name on it if you're interested.  \n>Me: I would be happy to take that off your hands.\n\nWith my limited reception, I formally accepted my invitation on Ultrasignup and paid the registration fee right then and there. Then Emily summited her first 14er. Also, we saw mountain goats. It was an exciting day all around.\n\nI posted the good news to social media, and almost immediately got a flurry of congratulatory messages and a few asking if I had taken Zach Miller's spot. Unbeknownst to me, he had just announced that he'd had an emergency appendectomy and didn't know if he could recover in time to run.\n\nThis ended up causing a bit of drama for me (yes, I'm going to make Zach's appendectomy about me for a moment; bear with me), because a few days later he announced that his doctor had cleared him to run. If I had Zach's spot, was there a possibility that Dale would now rescind my entry? The Hardrock Instagram page had posted a picture of me and then immediately deleted it. Plus, the lottery webpage still showed me on the waitlist. Was this all a big mistake? I was mostly sure that the organizers would honor my entry, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that I was going to go home empty handed. Between these thoughts and the lingering headache that I always get for the first few days at altitude, I became a sullen, miserable prick in the week leading up to Hardrock. Sorry Alex and Em!\n\nFinally, the day of the runner check in came, and I got my number. My mindset immediately flipped from the anxiety of \"Oh shit, I'm not running Hardrock\" to the anxiety of \"Oh shitfuckshit, I'm running Hardrock!\" I calmed my nerves by buying every piece of Hardrock swag available at their expo. I also made it my mission to introduce Emily to all of the most badass women we could find: Courtney Dauwalter, Anna Frost, Maggie Guterl, Stephanie Case, and Tara Warren. Pro tip: If you're too nervous to talk to famous people, just tell them your adorable baby girl wants to meet them.\n\n##**Cruising with Legends (miles 0-11)**\n\nBy the time I made it to the starting corral, I was positively vibrating with excitement. This was it: my dream race. Not only that, but I had my wife Alex, my daughter Emily, and some of my best friends (Jess, Boy Alex, and Virginia) there to crew and pace. The dream team for my dream race!\n\nDespite all the adrenaline, I started at my usual conservative pace. So conservative, in fact, that before we had even left the town of Silverton I was the very last runner. Given the amount of older Hardrock veterans at the start, I was a little surprised not to see anyone else walking, but I wasn't overly concerned. Back in 2019 I started the Ouray 100 in last place and worked my way up to 19th by the finish. Let's see how many people I could pass today!\n\nIt didn't take long before I caught up to a small pack of runners. I immediately recognized one of them as YouTuber and prolific race director Jamil Coury, who once ran a 29 hour Hardrock in his younger days but had shown up undertrained this year. A few minutes later, 17-time Hardrock finisher Chris Twiggs came charging out of the bushes, explaining simply, \"I had to take a massive shit.\" I had found the right crowd to run with. I also spent a few minutes running with American Ultrarunning Hall of Famer Pam Reed, who would tell me jokingly afterwards that I wasn't breathing nearly hard enough for a New Jersey runner. Nice to have some validation from a legend!\n\nThe pack slowly spread out and Chris and I ended up running as a duo. I took the opportunity to ask his advice about pacing, nutrition, which sections to carry extra water, etc. Normally this is the kind of stuff I would figure out weeks before a race, but I'd had sort of a mental block about studying the Hardrock course ahead of time. I think this was my small way of protecting myself against the potential disappointment of not getting in. Chris was a wealth of knowledge and was thrilled to have someone to share it all with. We reached the first aid station together quite a bit behind the splits I had given my crew, but I was feeling great and soaking in the experience.\n\nAt the pre-run briefing, Dale had described Hardrock as a \"culinary tour of the San Juans,\" explaining that each aid station prides itself on cooking gourmet food. I am typically pretty good at eating during races (and outside of races), and in that moment I decided that I was going to get my money's worth at every opportunity. In my three minute stop at KT, I consumed a full Denny's breakfast worth of bacon and pancakes.\n\n##**Views for Days... Literally (miles 11-28)**\n\nThe next section was the crown jewel of Hardrock: Grant Swamp Pass. Despite the name, this might be the most beautiful place in the world. A remote mountain pass with Island Lake on one side and a sweeping view of the San Joaquin ridge on the other. The top of the pass is guarded on both sides by unrelentingly steep scree.\n\nThe climb up took a bit of effort, but I was too distracted by the scenery to care. I passed the Joel Zucker memorial at the top and placed a rock on it. It's impossible to convey the severity of the terrain on the descent from the pass, [so instead I'll just link an old video of world class mountain runners struggling to stay upright on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qsrSsPRns).\n\nI managed to mostly stay upright through this section through an extensive application of upper body movement. That is to say, I flailed my arms wildly as my feet turned over at a thousand steps per minute. I reached the bottom with some scraped palms, both shoes full of debris, and a big stupid grin on my face. I sat down to empty my shoes and recognized Jenny Capel from the briefing. She had applied for ten years before getting in and had been recognized by the race director for her tenacity.\n\n\"Was that descent worth the wait?\" I inquired.  \n\"Fuck no.\" was the response.\n\nShe would go on to finish, hopefully enjoying the remaining sections a bit more than that one.\n\nI cruised into Chapman aid station in 115th place, having passed thirty people in the first 18 miles. I had told my crew not to make the rugged drive to this aid station, but I was instead greeted by my NY/NJ running friends Elaine, Tiffany, Devang, and Nobu, who had come out to crew for two more of my NY/NJ friends Stephen and Jun. They helped refill my bottles and got me back on the trail after just four minutes. Another lightning quick stop! Stephen and Jun were just ahead, and I hoped I could catch them and spend some time together.\n\nThe climb up Oscar's Pass is kind of an early crux of the race. Fully exposed to the afternoon sun and rising almost 3,000 feet in 2.4 miles, it can be a demoralizing climb. On the bright side, like the rest of the course it's breathtakingly beautiful. I passed the time by talking to a Utah-based runner named David Fuller, who would pass me on all the climbs, and whom I would pass back on every descent for the next 30+ hours. Just before the top of the pass, I caught Jun and we chatted for a few minutes. He was moving well but the altitude seemed to be taking its toll on him. He would end up having stomach issues but pushing through for his first Hardrock finish in 46 hours.\n\nThe descent into Telluride began as a talus slope but gradually transformed into flowy singletrack. I soaked in the extra oxygen as I dropped below 10,000' for the first time in many hours. I was still riding the high of running THE HARDROCK, I could hear the music thumping, and I was about to see my wife and daughter for the first time since the start. I could barely contain my emotions as I ran into the aid station, now in 89th place.\n\nIn my memory, Telluride was a long stop because I scarfed down a burrito, two slices of brisket, and a bunch of watermelon, I changed my socks, and my crew refilled my bottles while I told them about seeing Jun. In reality, all of this happened in just seven minutes. A far cry from Ludovic Pommeret's insane one minute turnaround but still respectable for a mid-pack runner.\n\nI planted a big sweaty kiss on Alex and Emily and I was on my way again.\n\n##**A Quick Stop at Kroger's for Snacks and Tequila (miles 28-44)**\n\nThe Kroger's Canteen aid station is the stuff of legends. Perched precariously at the top of the 13,000' Virginius Pass within a gap in the rocks that's barely bigger than a dining room table, Kroger's is staffed by the hardiest volunteers you'll ever meet. Alex and I had tried to hike to it a few weeks before the 2017 Hardrock but got turned around by deep snow. I was looking forward to finally reaching this mythical place.\n\nAll I had to do was climb 4,400 feet to get there.\n\nThe initial climb out of Telluride was uninspiring, rising steeply up dusty dirt roads as the afternoon sun bore down on us. Vandals had removed a few course markings, and I briefly followed another runner off course before checking my map and correcting our mistake. I heard rumbling in the distance and wondered if we would get a thunderstorm.\n\nHardrock is held in July as a compromise between allowing the snow to melt off the trails and avoiding the peak of the summer monsoon season. At the Ouray 100 in 2019, a bad thunderstorm had derailed my race. I had not carried enough spare clothing then, and perhaps as an overreaction to that trauma, I was now carrying enough gear to waterproof myself from head to toe. I was thankful for this decision as I imagined myself getting pummeled by a hail storm at 13,000'. Luckily, this was all a moot point as the storm passed harmlessly in the distance, dissipating the afternoon heat nicely in the process.\n\nI finally caught up to my friend Stephen England later in the climb. A type-1 diabetic, he has finished some of the hardest races in the world, making it clear that his disease doesn't limit him whatsoever. His blood sugar was a bit low and he sipped on a Dole fruit cup as he hiked up the steep slope.\n\nI called out \"Hey, it's Stephen America,\" which is our little inside joke that only I find funny.\n\nOnce again it was great to run into an east coast friend in the middle of the Colorado wilderness. Unfortunately our pace didn't quite match up and I had a date to attend up at 13,000' so I wished him well and continued on my way. He would end up finishing in 41 hours after a spectacular rally (aka project Saturday).\n\nAs the trail snaked its way around Mendota Peak on an ancient mining trail, I scanned the craggy ridge above me looking for a gap where it would be possible to wedge an aid station. I couldn't imagine where you could fit anything useful in this jumble of rocks, but suddenly I heard cheering. Directly above me was Kroger's Canteen.\n\n\"You're almost there!\" someone called out.\n\nI held up a finger and responded \"Be with you in a moment,\" before snapping a picture of them.\n\nThen I made the final scramble up to the aid station. It was getting chilly out, so I requested the hottest, saltiest food they could procure. Within seconds I received a handful of wonderfully crispy pan fried pierogis. It's also tradition to have a bit of tequila at Kroger's, so I asked for half a shot. I didn't see the drink being poured, but I heard a *glug glug glug* followed by a volunteer saying \"Whoa, that's a big half shot!\"\n\nWelp. Tradition is tradition, and maybe a little ethanol would give me the courage I needed for the vertical mile of descent into Ouray. Down the hatch!\n\nI thanked the volunteers profusely and set to work on the first pitch of the descent. Like Grant Swamp Pass, this section was utter silliness: nearly vertical scree and snow at 13,000'. This kind of terrain has no business being part of a 100 miler, and that's exactly what makes the Hardrock course so special. I attempted a standing glissade down the wall of snow and immediately slipped onto my butt, sliding down the remaining section while burping up smoky mezcal.\n\nI sat for a moment to empty snow and rocks from my shoes before realizing that I had nearly another mile of this kind of terrain ahead of me. I alternated between red-lining down impossibly steep, concrete-hard rock slides, resting on any stable rock, and then plunging downhill again. The terrain was like something straight out of Frozen Snot, but at altitude and with 32 miles on my legs. Insanity. Pure, wonderful, insanity!\n\nAfter the initial chaos, the course turned onto Camp Bird Road, which is a nicely groomed dirt road. This is the most runnable section of the Hardrock course, but I resisted pushing the pace to make sure I didn't blow my quads too early. A string of 11-12 minute miles had me in the town of Ouray in 75th place with 15 hours elapsed.\n\n##**The Long Dark Night (miles 44-58)**\n\nI shuffled into Ouray just as the last bit of sunlight faded over the horizon. I was confident that I had paced myself well in the early miles and I was excited to have friends to run with for the remainder of the race. \n\nFellow east coaster John Kemp was volunteering at Ouray and shuttled food from the aid station grill to my mouth like a mama bird. The culinary tour of the San Juans raged on as I devoured more brisket, a cheeseburger, an ice pop, and a Coke. Somehow I also managed to change my socks again, and I still made it out in eight minutes, now with my trusty training partner Jess keeping me company.\n\nOne vital omission from my feeding frenzy in Ouray was a coffee or an energy drink. I hadn't anticipated feeling sleepy at just 8pm, but a week of living in a Sprinter van with an 11 month old had left me severely sleep deprived going into the race. Jess - like all good pacers - is a prolific talker, and we often chat for the entirety of our training runs. But within a couple miles I found myself unable to muster the energy to respond to her. Despite her efforts (and despite being on the most dangerous section of the course), I was fading.\n\nI grunted occasional responses as Jess did her best to keep my mind going with hypothetical questions like, \"If you could watch a concert by any three bands from history, who would you pick and what order would they perform?\"\n\nAt the remote Engineer aid station, I asked for a coffee and a cup of ramen. I gulped them down like I was doing shots at a college bar and then realized that I was getting very cold very quickly. I put on every layer I had with me and called out \"See you later, Jess!\" I heard a squawk from her as she realized I was already leaving when she had only just gotten her own cup of Ramen. Luckily it only took a moment for her to catch up to me, and we were back to doing our 30min/mi march up to Engineer Pass.\n\nThe pass was marked by a blinking red light which was visible for an annoyingly long time. Climbing in the pitch black it was impossible to discern any progress toward that little blinky bastard. After an eternity, we finally made it to the top. I vaguely recall telling the light to go fuck itself, but that might have only happened in my mind.\n\nThe descent from the pass was on a relatively easy road but I couldn't find the will to run. We walked into the Animas Forks aid and I plopped down into a chair and announced to my crew that I would be taking a five minute nap. They bundled me in as many layers as they could find and set a timer. Despite my struggles, I had still moved up a few spots and now sat exactly in the middle of the pack at 70th place.\n\nUsually I wake up from these cat naps feeling rejuvenated, but I couldn't get my mind to turn off and instead I just listened to the commotion in the aid station. Nevertheless, when the timer went off, I put my shoes back on and headed back onto the trail with Boy Alex.\n\n##**The Lowest Point at the Highest Point (miles 58-93)**\n\n>*\"It’s gon’ be some work, you should pack a lunch for it\" —Prof*\n\nBecause of a road closure, my pacers would not be able to switch at Sherman like we had originally planned. This meant that Boy Alex would be pacing me from Animas Forks all the way to Cunningham Gulch, a 35 mile section with about 10,000 feet of climbing. Essentially he was doing a third of Hardrock while having to take care of a cranky baby. But Alex and I have shared a ton of miles on the trails together over the years, and living in the Wasatch he knows how to take care of himself and others in the mountains.\n\nAt 14,058', Handies Peak is the high point of the course. It is considered one of the easiest 14ers in Colorado, but the old saying holds true: there are no easy 14ers. That was particularly true after 22 hours of running at altitude. The sleep monster and the altitude monster teamed up on me big time here. When all was said and done, it took me three hours to cover the five miles to the summit. Thankfully, we were greeted by a beautiful sunrise. [And even better, someone from Mountain Outpost was there to film it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v77j9mAuHpE), so I have been able to appreciate the beauty of this section in retrospect.\n\nThe descent was milder than some of the previous ones, but I was wobbly on my feet from the sleep deprivation. I kept tripping and slipping on the loose rocks, until finally in a fit of despair I threw myself to the ground and rage napped. Alex was a few minutes behind me, having stopped for a bathroom break. I thankfully heard him coming and gave a little wave to make sure he didn't pass by my corpse.\n\nAfter another five minute snooze, we continued our trek to the Burrows backcountry aid for a quick stop, and then a short jog into the larger Sherman aid station. Once again, despite ten minutes of napping and probably an hour of time lost to inefficient shambling, I had moved up to 53rd place. That fact really underscores how difficult the night can be in a mountain race.\n\nUsually I come into each aid station with a plan, but I was so deliriously tired that I spent minutes just wandering around searching for something that would get me going again. I have a distant, cloudy memory of eating a breakfast burrito. That was probably tasty, I guess. I think I also chugged coffee. As a new father, I easily go through half a pot of coffee on a normal day, and that caffeine tolerance means I need to consume a positively stupid amount to stay alert during races. I distinctly remember that Elaine, Tiffany, and Devang all made the white-knuckle drive over Cinnamon Pass to see everyone at Sherman, and it was great to have some friends for support at a moment when my brain felt like a bowl of pudding.\n\nAnyway, someone or something must have convinced me to get back onto the trail, and I found myself wandering up the gentle climb to Cataract Lake. I recall Alex saying how beautiful and unexpected the lush forest was here, but I didn't have enough mental bandwidth to give a shit. Above tree line the scenery got even better, and somewhere in here Alex wandered off trail and [captured this video of me](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9zzdqFv052/).\n\nThis is another one of those moments that I'm grateful to have a recording to look back on, because at the time I wasn't able to appreciate how stunning the landscape was.\n\nMy mind started to come back online here, but the terrain made it difficult to get into a rhythm. The trail was narrow, rutted, and constantly crisscrossed Pole Creek. Rather than attempt to run, I just tried to maintain a fast power hike, which seemed to work well. However, it was becoming clear on the climbs that my lungs were shredded from thirty hours of running at altitude. Each deep breath resulted in a small coughing fit, and I was unable to generate any power despite my legs still feeling strong. I drowned out the noise of my own wheezing by blasting my rap playlist straight from my phone speakers. My apologies to any marmots who don't like Run the Jewels.\n\nThe last climb up and over Green Mountain was hilariously steep over cross country terrain. We were coming to the end of Alex's gargantuan pacing section. With a final 1,600' descent in just over a mile, we arrived at Cunningham Gulch, mile 93. I gave Alex a big hug, kissed my Alex and Emily, grabbed some snacks from the aid station, and headed out with Jess for the final nine miles.\n\n##**The Home Stretch (miles 93-102)**\n\nI had originally told the crew that 36 hours might be possible if I had a perfect race. I arrived at this estimate based on my 35:27 finish at TWOT, which is supposedly similar in difficulty to Hardrock. With 36:22 elapsed and time being linear, this goal appeared to be unlikely. I had also mentioned that anything under 40 hours would be pretty satisfying, but that the bottom line was to carry Emily through the finisher chute and kiss the rock. This mental image had been propelling me since the start of the race.\n\nBut still, the allure of 40 hours was strong. That gave us 3:38 to go the last nine miles: two miles straight up Little Giant Pass and seven miles downhill to the finish. On paper that sounds reasonable, but my lungs were staging a full scale rebellion. I was breathing so frantically on the climb that Jess turned around multiple times to ask if I was ok.\n\n\"Yeah, that's just what my lungs do now,\" I responded.\n\nI had made the wise decision before the race not to have my watch display mile splits. If it had, I would have seen a split of 65 minutes for the first mile of the climb. Granted, that mile had 1,200 feet of ascent, but I believe it to be my slowest ever in a race. Mile two was a significant improvement at just 59 minutes. Dang. Speedy.\n\nWe reached the top just in time for sunset. Jess asked if I wanted to stop for a picture and I flipped her the double bird and sprinted away. Or according to her recollection, I sort of grunted with ennui and kept walking. It's unknowable which one of us is remembering this correctly.\n\nThat left us with 1:35ish for the last seven miles. Not terrible. We just had to average 13-14 minutes per mile on some relatively mild downhill trails, if I was remembering this section correctly. I've certainly run faster than that on the final descent of other races.\n\nWhat I hadn't remembered from hiking this section many years ago, was that the first mile was more loose scree.\n\n\"Wow this section is pretty tough, Je-oof!\" I said as my feet slid out from under me.\n\nI heard a yelp from behind me and saw Jess also sitting on the trail in a dust cloud. Folks, only the best pacers will time their falls to coincide with yours. It's called teamwork.\n\nThat first mile ended up being 19 minutes, which really ate into our cushion. As the terrain got better, Jess ran ahead and started pushing the pace, finding the best line through the rutted Jeep roads. I willed my quads to absorb each downhill step, audibly panting with each breath.\n\n\"Stay with me, Ryan. We can do 40 hours,\" she would call back every few minutes.  \n\"I'm fuckin' trying, brah.\" is what I would have said if my lungs were still capable of speaking.\n\nWe picked up the pace: 14 minute mile, 13:12, 13:17. This was gonna be close. We hit a rolling section next to the Animas River and I forced myself to run every step through every creek crossing and every diabolical little uphill.\n\n\"Shitgoddamnitwhatthefuck?!\" Jess yelled as we reached yet another short steep climb and were forced to walk.\n\nWith a mile to go, Jess turned to me and said, \"We have seven minutes to do this. Do you want to go for it?\"\n\nAnd while yeah, it would have been cool to say that I closed out Hardrock with a 6:59 mile and finished under 40 hours, what I wanted more than that was to calmly pick up Emily and walk her through the finisher chute of the first ultramarathon that she ever saw Daddy run.\n\nAlso, I desperately had to poop and didn't like the idea of finishing with shit-filled shorts.\n\nAfter I made a quick stop in the woods, we walked the final mile to the center of Silverton, making sure to break into a jog once we were within sight of the finish line crowd.\n\nThen I gently picked up a very sleepy Emily who was wearing a very fuzzy bear suit.\n\nAnd we kissed the rock.\n\nFinal time 40:14:42, 52nd place.\n\n##**Closing Thoughts**\n\nFinishing at 10pm and being dead tired for most of the race meant that I got a surprisingly good night of sleep. Alex nudged me awake around 6am to remind me that the Hardrock depletion mile was starting soon. I really wanted to get the full Hardrock experience so I trudged over to the Silverton track and did my best impression of a real runner. My legs felt surprisingly good, and I was on pace for a 6:40 mile through the first lap until my lungs reminded me that we were still at altitude. Whatever, it was fun.\n\nThe awards ceremony was held on the other end of town under gorgeous blue skies. They served an amazing breakfast and I got to spend some time sharing battle stories with Stephen, Jun, and our pacers. Then my crew spent the rest of the day soaking our feet in Animas River and sipping on local beer. It was a perfect way to end the weekend.\n\nWhen I think back on this race months after the fact, the feeling that comes to mind is an overwhelming sense of gratitude. I can't adequately express how thankful I am for the opportunity to run this race and for the time and effort that my family and friends put into making it happen. Thank you to Alex and Emily for kisses, cheers, moral support, and allowing me to spend way too many hours on the weekends doing hill repeats at the Water Gap. Thanks to Jess and (Boy) Alex for pacing me through some of the toughest terrain I've ever seen and to Virginia for being on Emily duty so my Alex could focus on me at aid stations. And another huge thanks to Dale Garland and the Hardrock community for putting on such a world class event. This was a truly special experience. Congratulations to Stephen, Jun, and all the other new Hardrockers.\n\nOh and kudos to Emily's new BFF Courtney Dauwalter for breaking her own course record!\n\nWith the benefit of some time to reflect, I have accepted that I can have my dream race without running my dream time.\n\nI still want to go back and break 40 hours though."

I thought it might take a little longer, but after getting a 1:29 half marathon last year, I made it my mission to get under 3.\n\nI signed up for Grandma's and Whistlestop Marathon. For Grandma's I did Pfitzinger's 18 week, 55 mile peak training plan and stuck very close to it. I was feeling pretty confident when I got achilles tendonitis 5 weeks prior to the race, and it was so bad any pressure gave pain so I basically sat on the couch for 3 weeks just so I could make it to the start line, died at mile 18, but still PRed by 25 minutes from 2 years ago.\n\nI took a month off to trail run before doing my own abbreviated version of the plan, about 12 weeks which I did by cutting off the build up of the first 6 weeks. I wasn't' as consistent as I would have liked due to heat and anxiety and other such excuses, so coming up to this race I was unsure if I could hit 3 but was going to try anyways. I had done 5 20-21 mile runs in the 12 weeks to make sure I could last longer into the race, plus I had done a 14 mile run at race pace 2 weeks prior to the race so that gave a bit of confidence.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nHad my pre race coffee and oatmeal, put some nuun in a water bottle for some early morning hydration, and got in the car to head to the race. It was 45 degrees, overcast, with very little wind. I warmed up in joggers, and a jacket. I thought I was going to run in arm sleeves and gloves at least at first, but I was warm enough to start without. I got chatting with some of the runners at the start line, and we all mused how today was about as perfect as it gets, and we would really have no excuse other than our training for how we did that day.\n\n# Race\n\nRace was amazing! First mile was on road before turning onto a gravel rail trail. Prior to the race I peeped at some old photos to see if my metaspeeds would be acceptable, and it seemed like other runners had similar shoes. However, then next 5 miles or so we were running single file because there were so few places without a good amount of looser gravel. Still, I focused on hitting my paces and the paying attention to the gorgeous fall colors peaking on either side of me.\n\nAfter that the trail cleared up a fair bit and 3 of us emerged as the 3 hour run group since there were no pacers. Pretty much the next 15 miles were uneventful. We went downhill slowly but surely, some people joined our group, others went ahead, and some dropped back, but myself and the top woman stayed together, giving encouragement to each other.\n\nI was trying a different fueling strategy of a gel every 3.5 miles instead of every 4, and I had my wife bring a 10 ounce flask of liquid IV for me to drink between 2 aid stations, which I did around mile 10 and 18. Part of why I did poorly in Grandma's was obviously fitness, but I felt underfueled, particularly in electrolytes. This felt more dialed in and I didn't have any GI issues.\n\nComing into the final stretch, myself and the woman were getting more and more hyped about finishing under 3, and we were both still pretty confident 22 miles in, but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be for either of us. Around miles 23/24 she dropped back, and I also fell off pace. My quads just couldn't keep pushing it. She came back stronger to pass me at mile 25, and ultimately finished under 3:02, and I felt super excited to finish without stopping and to set a PR.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI congratulated some of the runners I worked with along the way, attempted to drink a beer not super successfully, got a hot shower and changed, then grabbed my timing receipt to find out despite being 10th overall male that I was 5th in my age group. Still, I grabbed some amazing pizza and just soaked up the day, feeling good and that with the proper training I could easily go under 3. My pacing was phenomenal and something I couldn't stop looking at on Strava. Next year I am planning on running almost entirely trail ultras, but may end up running a road marathon if I feel strong enough to go sub 3 by the end of the year. I would definitely recommend this race. It was beautiful, great slow downhill course, and generally well run."

In November 2023 I was \\~300lbs. 12+ years ago in high school I was 165, but ever since then I’ve been 200+ and for most of the past 10 years 250lbs+. Running has always been my go-to form of exercise for whatever reason, though as I’m sure you can imagine I was certainly never consistent with it. The longest streak was at the beginning of COVID because I used it as a way to just get out of the house. Unfortunately I stopped about 5 months later as I was preparing for my wedding that was now going to be virtual (of course that really was just an excuse—I could have kept running if I wanted to, but let that be my easy way out).\n\nAnyway, mid-November of last year I finally decided I wanted/needed to be healthy, started counting calories and eating less junk food, and on December 8th I started running at least 5 days a week every morning. It was only 2-3 miles and it was at a 14:00+ pace, but it’s what really kickstarted my health journey. I made running the one thing I absolutely had to do, and because of that I found myself eating healthier at night, because I knew when I ran the next morning I’d feel worse depending on what I ate. For the next several months I also slowly changed my diet, reducing calories little by little and also making one significant change per week to further make my diet healthier.\n\nAs an obese and out of shape guy, I ran everything slow these 10 months, but little by little I started increasing my miles and pace. In February I was running 20 miles a week with a 5-7mi long run; by April it was 30 miles, running every day, with an 8-9-mile long run (eventually consistently doing a 10 mile long run each week), and it was around this time that I noticed I had fallen in love with running. While my biggest goal was still losing weight and improving my health, I no longer thought of running as exercise or just a way to help weight loss, but it truly had become so much more—it’s a huge part of me now, something I have to do as much as I have to do anything else I love, and is as much for my mental health as my physical.\n\nThis was made even more apparent at the beginning of May when I strained my Achilles tendon. I had gotten new shoes that didn’t fit very well and in a moment of frustration stupidly decided to loosen them a ton; a few steps later I must've stepped wrong and felt a sharp pain. I ended up having to stop running completely for 2 weeks, which felt like the longest 2 weeks of my life haha. But I did strength training daily instead, got physical therapy, and luckily after a month it was completely healed. It also gave me a healthier view of overall fitness, as I now take two days off from running each week (at that point I had stopped taking any days off, too), strength training instead. \n\nI again had to build up my mileage slowly, starting my long run at 7 miles in early June and slowly increasing. At the beginning of August I did my first 12 mile run and did a weekly 12-mile run up until the Half (40 mpw total: 2 days of 6 miles, 2 days 8 miles, then one 12). I didn’t go past 12 miles at the advice of a friend who thought I should make the Half special by letting it be the first time I had run that far. While I was itching to keep increasing my distance, I am glad I followed his advice! I was fully confident I could run that far because of how many 12s I did, but it also made it extra special.\n\nThe other thing of note is at this point I was only eating around 1000-1500 calories a day, and everything was still pretty much at an easy pace, though I’d push myself once or twice a week to go just a little faster. I was at around 10:00 pace for everything, with my best 12 mile run being a 9:36 pace a couple weeks before which felt like a pretty high effort. All that to say: I guess I didn’t really train specifically for this, but instead just started running as long as I could (slowly going further and further) at a relatively easy pace since December. In terms of prepping specifically for this race, I probably didn’t need to, but I did do a sort of taper the week before, running only around 18 miles; I took Friday off before the race, and just did a very easy 2 miles on Saturday.\n\nAs for nutrition I don’t usually eat anything before or during my runs, just drink coffee before and water during/before. For my long runs I have experimented with a few different things including Huma gels, and I’ll sometimes eat a banana beforehand. But, for the week leading up to the race I did make sure I finally wasn’t at such a high calorie deficit, as I upped my intake to 2000-2500 calories per day the whole week and specifically ate more carbs Thursday-Saturday.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe morning of the race I woke up at 3:30 (and managed to actually sleep around 5 hours! Usually when I force myself to go to bed early it doesn’t really work) so I had time to drink coffee, airborne, and water, as well as eat a banana around 4:45. I had planned to get to the race around 5:45 but traffic for parking was even worse than I thought: I was still in line a block away and it was nearing 6:10. Luckily my wife was with me to cheer me on, so I jumped out and walked/jogged to the start line. She didn’t end up being able to park until 6:45, so I’m glad I did jump out as I definitely would’ve missed the first wave if I had stayed!\n\nThe only thing is I had to quickly choose between glasses or sunglasses and, because we had gotten heat warnings from the race, I chose sunglasses since I thought it’d get sunny quickly but in the usual LB fashion the marine fog layer was pretty thick for the whole race. So things were just extra dark for me lol. Got to the start line around 6:20 and luckily was no longer nervous but just excited!\n\n# Race\n\nI started strong but knew about all the horror stories of people starting too quickly so I tried to keep it at a relatively easy pace (though I’m sure my excitement heightened what I thought was easy). After about a mile I noticed that the sub-1:50 pacer was right behind me, and since I still felt good I sped up a tiny bit just so I could try to stay ahead, thinking if I could stay ahead of him for the first half then I should definitely be able to hit my sub-2:00 goal. Until I started running the race I honestly wasn’t sure I’d be able to do it; I had barely run 12 miles in under 2 hours previously, so my goal was to do the Half under 2:00, but I felt really good running at around an 8:20-8:30 pace. At some point the pacer must have passed me, as I lost track of him about 2/3rds of the way which ended up being better for me as I stopped thinking so much about pace and instead just focused on the running.\n\nI took a single Huma cafe mocha gel around the 6 mile mark when I saw an aid station coming up so I could take it with water, and I took the electrolyte drink accidentally at one of the earlier stations (just because I’ve never taken electrolytes before, so I wasn’t planning to, but accidentally grabbed it instead of water) and then on purpose at another since the first went well. Otherwise I just took water at every aid station, drinking more than I usually do on long runs but I think it helped.\n\nMiles 9.5-12 were definitely the hardest, after the turnaround from the beach and with the gradual uphill. I don’t know if it was due to exhaustion and my body being happy it was almost over, or just ‘cause I’m an emotional dude in general and being so happy that I was, somehow, actually running as well as I was and was going to make it, but I started to kinda cry in the middle of the 11 mile mark. But it was a relieved, happy cry, and felt great. The second hardest spot was the steeper hill at mile 4 which I just took too quickly and left me with less energy than I wanted, though luckily that didn’t last long. At mile 12 I tried to increase the pace a little, and ran all out once I saw the finish line.\n\n# Post-race\n\nIt’s weird, I started my journey barely able to imagine I’d ever be able to run 13 miles, but as the race got closer and I was consistently running 12-milers, I instead wondered how fast I’d be able to run it, thinking I’d maybe barely make it in under 2:00. Being by the 1:50 pacer during the race for so long made me think maybe I’d be able to get around there, so I had that goal in the back of my mind during the race, and I can’t believe I did! I’m incredibly happy with my result, and now I’m just excited to do a full marathon. After the race I hugged my wife and ate two more bananas plus drank a bunch of water, and then waited for a friend to finish.\n\nThis is also probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done, at least in terms of physical exertion, yet at the same time I never felt terrible. In fact, my legs miraculously never felt tired, it was more my stomach feeling heavy (likely due to consuming more calories than usual the week before, plus the fact that I still have a little bit of belly fat) and my shoulders feeling weak/heavy, which has never happened before; I guess I need to do more strength training haha. But despite how hard it was, it was also one of the greatest experiences of my life—even with the difficulty I loved every minute, and had such an incredible time. \n\nI’m hoping to maybe do the LA marathon in March, and to mayyyybe try for a sub-4hr? I’m not sure how much farther I would’ve lasted at my pace for the half, so I’m not super optimistic I’ll be able to do it, but I guess we’ll see how the next 5 months go! My goal again is just to at least finish. I might add some speed training once a week or so, but otherwise I plan to just kinda keep doing what I’ve been doing: gradually extending my long runs and little by little quickening my pace. This has been a lifechanging journey for me, and I'm excited to keep going!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

To register, you need to enter credit card details, so they can take out the race fee if your name is drawn. I got lucky and I got in first go. My wife is always keen for a weekend away, so we booked flights and accommodation in an afternoon.\n\nI'd been training pretty hard to improve my 5k time, and hadn't run a marathon since September 2023 ([Race Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/s/hs0rhkQBMN)). My weekly volume was fairly good, and I knew that I could transition to a marathon plan pretty easily after I ran another 5k in June (Wollongong Running Festival). \n\nI took a little while to decide what my training plan would be. Eventually, I settled on Jack Daniels' 2Q 18 week plan from the Third Edition of his book (Jack Daniels' Running Formula). I chose 75 km (~46.5 miles) as my peak weekly volume. The plan consists of 2 weekly quality workouts (Q runs), and the rest of your weekly mileage is made up with 3-4 easy runs. Peak workout distance was 29km (18 miles). Let me tell you, running in miles hits different. \n\nThe workouts were some easy miles, mixed in with efforts at marathon pace, or threshold pace, or fast reps. The two sessions per week were very rarely less than 22km. The interesting thing about this plan is that you hit peak volume pretty early, at 12 weeks out. You then bounce between 90% and 100% of peak volume. I've run this far in a week before, but not for so many weeks. \n\nThe first four weeks of the plan, my wife and I were on holiday in Europe. It was pretty special running in all of those foreign places. A good way to speed run sight-seeing. Some of the quality workouts were definitely affected by me stopping to take numerous photos. No regrets. The flight home caused me to miss a few runs, but nothing too serious that early on in the plan. I also got sick when I returned home, so that caused me to miss a couple of runs as well. \n\nOnce I was back to real life, I settled into the grind that is a marathon training block. Most of my runs were done in the morning, before sunrise. Often with my run club (@neverlazyrunclub), but often by myself, from home. \n\nIn the middle of August, 9 weeks out from race day, I did City2Surf in Sydney. It's a 14km fun run from the centre of the city to Bondi Beach, notorious for its hilly course. As an indication of my improving fitness, I set a 10k PB in the first 10km, and then beat that in the last 10km. Confidence was building. \n\nOne hiccup occurred six weeks out when a pair of new shoes gave me blisters that were bad enough that I had to miss a long run. I bought a new pair of Kayanos, because they were on sale, and my tibialis anterior did not like those at all. I eventually developed significant pain in my right shin that I worried was a shin splint. A visit to the physio confirmed that it wasn't that, and the new shoes were likely the culprit. So I had to buy *another* pair of shoes. I did miss a few runs, and had a forced down week 5 weeks out from race day. Fortunately, I recovered well and was able to jump back into training where I left off. \n\nMy workouts from that point felt very strong. My confidence was high heading into race week. I was entertaining thoughts of decreasing my goal time of 3:40. \n\nThis plan has a short taper. Three and two weeks out were 90% of peak (67.5km) and the final week was almost 60km, though this was heavily loaded to earlier in the week. \n### Pre-race\nFlew down to Melbourne on Friday. My wife and I had decided to make a weekend of it. Carb loading in Melbourne was pretty nice, though refraining from the local beers was a punish.\n\nTried to stay off my feet as much as I could.\nWoke up at 5am for a 7am race start. Ate a peanut butter and honey roll, an apple and a Powerade. The 20 minute walk to the start line was my warm-up. Managed to make use of the ports-loo before the race start, which was a great relief.\n\nI was a rookie and didn't have a throw away jumper on, so I was shivering in the corral. \n\n### Race\nThere aren't any starting waves here. It's all self-seeded and everyone funnels through together. I'd managed to get a spot just behind the 3:40 pacers. I had to be patient as I made my way through the starting masses. The first km was perfectly on my goal pace of 5:13.\n\nBy km 3, I'd caught up to the 3:40 pacers. I put them behind me, just to be safe. The course then takes us around Albert Park. I got chatting to one of the Spartans (this was his 37th Melbourne Marathon) at 7km. I remember thinking at km 12 that I felt relatively comfortable, but it wasn't easy per se. I had been going faster than my goal pace since that first km. I made several conscious efforts to slow down, but the pace of the pack around me, combined with the pacer group not being too far behind (or so I thought) prevented me from mentally being able to. \n\nThere are a lot of straight sections on this course. I thought I would hate that, be it actually helped me get into a bit of a rhythm and get lost in my head.\n\nI took a SIS gel every 30 minutes. The third and fifth gels were  caffeinated. I took water at every aid station, and Gatorade when I could grab some.\n\nMy Garmin was ticking off the kilometres about 300m before the on course markers. So I wasn't ever really sure how far ahead I was. But then the halfway marker came up, I was able to work out that I was 1:18 ahead of goal time.\n\nThe second half seemed to go by quicker than the first. The course joins up with half marathon race after heading away from St Kilda, past Albert Park. I previous races, I've really enjoyed having the half-marathoners there to help beef up the field. But I could see the 2:30 pacer for the half, and I had great a bit of pace over these half-marathoners. So I had to do a lot of weaving through the field, which was the last thing I wanted to do. \n\nAfter 30km, my legs got a bit heavy and my left knee got quite painful. I'd had no knee issues in training, so this was a surprise to me. Fortunately it went away after a couple of minutes.\n\nI'd read about the ascent along Birdwood Avenue at 37km, and how it breaks people. A lot of the people near me slowed down, but I'm happy to say I ate my vegetables during training (and ran those hills). I managed to power up the hill with very little time lost.\n\nAfter that, it's mostly downhill, and it was all about hanging on. Apparently my wife was shouting at me outside the MCG, but I don't remember hearing anyone calling my name. Dug in for the half lap of the MCG and finished strong. \n\n### Post-race\n Took in the crowd atmosphere, made my way underneath the stands of the MCG to grab a drink, a banana and my finishers shirt. Met up with my wife on the grass outside the stadium, and stretched down. Did a shoey, and gingerly walked to the tram to the hotel.\n\nEnjoyed an afternoon at a local brewery. We head home on Monday (today). I'm a little sore, but I can tell my recovery won't take too long.\n\nI think I maybe could have pushed for sub 3:35. There were definitely moments in the last 10km that I could've pushed a bit harder, but it would've been tough, and I didn't want to risk blowing up. Overall, I'm very happy with the race day effort, and the training block overall.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

Previous efforts.  4:30 (2021) and 3:59 (2023).  \n\nIn between the last marathon and this years I really caught the bug and was running quite consistently the whole year.  My aim was to hit at least 50km per week every week which I did except for one week in April around another shorter race, and during the taper.  \n\nThrough ramping up I loosely followed the Hal Higdon Intermediate 2 program though usually I was exceeding the weekly distance.  A bit of speed work was included as I had my eye on improving my 10km time.  Throughout this prep I hit 30km or more on 6 runs though never more than 32.  My usually training pace was 5:20-5:30 min/km which usually felt easy.  No injuries at all in training which helped a great deal.  Peak weekly distance was around 80km.\n\n\n### Pre-Race - Through race week I cut all dairy as it doesn’t agree with my guts.  Also tried to carbo load more than normal as I saw Aussie Olympian Brett Robinson talk about it so I tried to eat as much white rice as possible in the 3-4 days leading up.  I also drank bulk Powerade and upped my magnesium a bit.  I got myself some Nike Alphaflys and only lightly broke them in with a brisk 10km. \n\n### Race - It was a cold start at 0700 to but turned into a breezy warm day.  I had payed up for the VIP package which got a cool place to get ready and a preferred start just behind the elites.  No bag drop to deal with either.\n\nThe first half of the Melbourne Mara tends downhill as you run away from the city.  There was also a slight breeze at our backs.  For the first 5km I felt like I  was over racing slightly, clocking splits of about 4:40min/km.  The heart rate was high but my legs were fresh so I decided to go with it.  Once I got to about 7km my mindset shifted from “slow down”, to a solid mantra of “just travel”, aiming to cruise between km 7 and 30 without any real mental energy expended.  Pace in this period was consistent 4:45-4:50 and while heart rate remained solidly in zone 4 and pushing into zone 5 I was feeling quite good so decided to stick with the pace.\n\n  I stuck to my race plan of a gel every 5km and to walk briefly at each drink station so I could finish my cup.  At the 30km (where the race starts) the course turns away from the beach and trends uphill.  This coincided with running back into the breeze which was warming and stiff.  I took the first of two Crampfix sachets as was my plan.  These things taste like death but I swear by their effectiveness.  Pushing on back towards the city I was starting to feel good about being able to run the distance out solidly.  Around 9km to go I got my first hint of cramp in my hamstrings which can be a problem for me.  I tried to be mindful of it, acknowledging the issue but not dwelling on it and pushed on, maintaining a solid pace of about 4:50.  With about 7km to go the only real hard hillls arrive with one solid 1.5km slope slowing me down a bit and I had my slowest split of around 5:35.  This area is also problematic with half marathon runners mixing in.  The group I caught up to were 2:10 HM pace so fairly busy and tricky but thankfully no issues.  I also drank my second Crampfix about then.  Through this period I believe the Alphaflys earned their price tag.  I could still progress at a decent pace without getting into a slog.  \n\nWith 4km to go I was doing the sums and realised I would get my goal time unless I had a major issue.  I had one bad hamstring cramp and stopped for a couple of seconds but managed to run it off.  The last two kms are slightly downhill before turning and finishing in the iconic MCG.  Not worries about pace or fatigue I maintained pace to finish in good shape.  Achieving my goal time felt like a stretch pre race but a good all round run and being prepared to go with the flow early paid off.  Good to finish without feeling ruined.  I could take it all in and enjoy it.\n\n### This was definitely the best I’ve pulled up from my three marathons.  Slightly sore knee and the obligatory sore quads but no calf, hamstring or foot pain or any chaffing.  The shoes worked a treat, I am super glad I spent the money.  \n\nKey learnings from this for me is that you can’t buy a good prep.  You have to earn it.  I did way more than previous years and it really paid off.  Also a taper which I was stressed about.  I thought this week I may have started it too early.  I gained a couple of kg pre-race and I thought that might hurt me but the big prep and big taper lead to a good slingshot into the race.  \n\nIf I was to think about how I could get faster it’s just more speed.  I am planning to try and break 40mins for 10km (current PB 43:21) and will put in some time on the track with fast 1km repeats.  \n\nI’m glad I didn’t stress about heart rate.  Garmin watch said I had 2hrs 30 in zone 4 and 1 hr in zone 5.  I see a lot of people wanting to race in zone 3.  That’s a rookie mistake IMO.  \n\nAlso the thought that running faster doesn’t mean it’s harder.  Less time on your feet, in the sun and wind can counteract with the additional stress of going faster.\n\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.\n"

I had tried starting to run many times before, but for some reason I started to fall in love with it for the first time. It was an amazing de-stressor, I felt awesome afterwords and overall better about my self when working it in. Less depressed, gave me confidence and energy - just so much better mentally. I also felt  calmer and less anxious due to having an \"energy-releasing\" activity. Once I was able to run the length of my local park in full (7 miles) I knew I was ready to take on some new challenges since achieving that felt so good! I had a friend who had picked up running at around the same time and we both signed up for halfs and fulls, to give ourselves something to work for throughout the next year. \n\nI signed up for my first half in April of 2024, and subsequently my first full (this Maine Marathon). I thought if I had a year I'd have enough time to train, and it'd keep me running throughout the year. My first half came by and I got a time of 1:57:54 - following the 'Alien Method' in Jack Daniels book. I kept base building at around 30-40 mpw as I looked around for plans to do for my full marathon. I was between Hanson Beginner and Pfitz 18/55, and ended up going the latter since it usually had 5 days of running instead of 6. Starting off the block, I became a little nervous and thought I was over my head with picking this plan. The workouts (especially LT) were HARD - but I stuck with it. I missed a week or so in the start with vacation, but the amount of days missed fell within Pfitz range of being okay. The real block started after that, with 50+ weeks and 20 milers. Honestly, those weeks were good most of the time besides some brutal summer runs. I kept reminding myself that this would help with fall PRs! \n\nI trained for a 4:10 MP, doing 9:20 to 9:30 miles for my marathon pace workouts. As I got closer to the race I thought that I could push this, and make my stretch goal 4:00.\n\nIn the last 8 weeks of training, I missed about 2 days so I felt pretty good going into the race. Unfortunately, I look at my watch too much - and was getting discouraged with some of my vo2 max going down and race predictors going up. It also said I was \"peaking\" a couple weeks too early but I trusted my training and tried to ignore all these fancy metrics!\n\n### Pre-race\nWe drove up to Portland on Thursday night, relaxed for a couple days and explored a bit before the race day.\n\nThe morning of the race I woke up to pee around 4:00AM (race wasn't till 7:45) and as you could guess I could not sleep again after this! The adrenaline was pulsing and I was ready to go. I ate some bread with peanut butter, banana, and honey and got a bit of coffee going. Once my friend who signed up with me was ready, we walked over to the starting line! It was a crispy 40 degrees and sunny, I was cold but knew this was perfect running weather. We got to the start line and I aligned myself in between the 4:00 and 4:20 pacers, and my friend headed closer to the 5 hour pacers. The national anthem played, and we were off!\n\n### Race\nThe first 6 or so miles were great, crowd support was fantastic and everything was going smoothly. I was freezing to start, so it felt great to get moving. By around Mile 5 or 6 I felt like I was in a groove and finally warmed up. My first thought was that this course was not as flat as I thought. We moved up and down through rolling hills throughout 6 through 13 and I knew I'd be cursing some of these on the way back. In my head I split the race into 3 9 milers, and wanted to try to push the pace whenever we got to the next 9. \n\nAt 14mi-15mi I saw my friend since it was an out and back, and we let out a loud cheer for each other which gave me a nice boost. I made sure to drink water at every single aid station, and ate either a Honey Stinger, or Clif Bloks every 45 minutes. Additionally, I took a saltstick electrolye pill every 45 minutes. This fueling did me well I think, as I never really hit the \"wall\". I kept trucking along and eventually hit 20, the most I'd ever ran. I knew this is where the real race would start.\n\nI remembered one section of Pfitz that mentioned that with our superior training, we'd be ready for the last 6 miles. He mentioned to pick a victim in the distance, and try to pass them. Continue this with more people for the last 6 miles. I envisioned this moment for a while, and he was completely right. I figured if I had anything left in the tank, I should leave it all in these last 6 (as you can see from my splits) thankfully, most of the last 6 was a nice downhill as well so I was letting the momentum take me. I must have passed 15+ people in this last stretch, and I really felt great that I was able to push! Pfitz was correct, haha. The bibs noted if it was our first marathon, and hearing a stranger go \"yeahhhh get that first one\" gave me a nice push. The pain really started around 22-23mi. I started feeling some cramps coming up everytime I slowed down, in my foot and in my hamstring. I knew that I just had to keep running to stop this from happening so that was another motivator! Also felt a small blister coming in a common spot I'd gotten before in these shoes, so just tried to adjust my gait a bit and fight against that.\n\nAt around 24-25mi, I got a notification from racejoy that my expected finish time was 3:59:59 - and I pushed with everything I had left. I still thought that sub-4 may be possible after the halfway point, but didn't think it was this close to in range. I sprinted as much as I could the last two miles, somehow hitting 7:30 paces for small stretches and finally crossed the finish line!\n\nChip time was officially 4:01:47, although Strava seems to think I broke sub 4. I think I may have with some weaving around and adding (watch and strava said 26.52) but I will go with the chip time. Honestly I smashed my goal from starting (4:10) so I couldn't be mad at all. An official sub-4 is def in my future!\n\n### Post-race\nI went it to a short state of emotional and physical shock after, just being thankful and not believing that I actually ran a marathon. My fiancee was at the finish line which was amazing, and we sat for a bit and got the post-race snacks. After feeling relatively back to normal, I headed to the beer garden and waited for my friend to finish! Once he crossed, we all relaxed at the finishing area for a bit before going back to our AirBnb, and relaxing on the couch. After some hours of doing nothing we all destroyed a Mexican dinner later at night. The feeling of finishing this feat was awesome, and I did have a strong emotional moment back at the Airbnb after the finish. I was just so happy so many of my friends & family wanted to track me and support me on this goal. Their words after meant so much. I started thinking about myself from a year ago, 2 years, 10 years ago. If you told that guy he'd run a marathon someday he'd be really confused and shocked, lol. As an asthmatic who never really thought they could do anything like this it was quite surreal. So that held a lot of weight for me and I was super thankful and proud of myself.\n\nUnfortunately, as a person who watches my watch too much - somehow my fitness is apparently declining and vo2 max is going down. Not sure how that's possible with running an almost sub-4 marathon. Oh well - this happened during the transition to summer too so maybe my body doesn't do too well with the weather changes.\n\nNow, I'm following Pfitz recovery schedule and giving myself some time to think of a new goal. I love running so I defintely want to continue. Maybe I'll get my half time down, or work to a 50k distance, work in some trails, not really sure. I'll let myself rest a bit before deciding that. Since I technically PR'd my half on the second half of the marathon I think it makes sense to maybe work on my half time! Again, going to rest on it a bit before committing to anything. Thanks to anyone who read! Appreciate this community so much. <3 \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

It took me 4 months to go from 0 to 5km (I had very strong anxiety at the time, and running would give me panic attacks in the beginning), and another 7 months to reach 10km. I ran my first half marathon 2 months later in preparation for my first race (20km of Brussels) in May 2024. Two weeks after this race, I signed up for the marathon.\n\nFor the Marathon: \nI used the Ben Parkes Marathon Plan Beginner - L1 and switched around the days for it to best fit my schedule.  It was an 18-week plan, peaking around 48km with a 3 week taper. \nI work full-time, so I was able to do all my runs in the mornings and long runs on Saturdays.  \nI also followed Ben Parkes' strengthening plan with one leg strengthening session per week. \n\nMy typical training week looked like this: \nMon: Rest (bouldering)\nTue: Speed training session\nWed: Leg strengthening (+EZ run later on in the plan)\nThu: Short EZ run\nFri: Rest (bouldering)\nSat: Long run\nSun: Full rest day\n\nI was very consistent with my running until the week before peak week, only missed the long run on week 7 because I was sick.\nThe long run before peak week was 32km. All was well until about 20km in, when my knee started hurting. I pushed on and felt pretty pained until 27km, where I had to take a walking break. Forced myself to finish the 5km to get home and was limping the rest of the weekend. \n\nWent to a sports specialist next week who told me that due to my overpronation, I had worn down my shoes, which was hurting my knee. He gave me insoles. \nI had to skip 2 runs in peak week and reduced my long run to a 5km. I was hoping the insoles would be a quick fix (I had a similar issue in the other knee in Sept 2023), but alas, my knee kept hurting whole running even with the insoles. I tried to take it easy during my first taper week, limiting myself to 2 runs, and took the rest of the week to rest.\n\n In the second taper week, I felt some pain again during my first run and started to freak out a bit. Did a lot of research online and on reddit and self-diagnosed itbs. I started rolling my tfl with a rubber ball and did 2x 10 Clam shells, lateral leg raises, and monster walks twice a day. I limited my runs to 5km that week and did an extra 2 sessions of an itbs recovery routine I found online. \n\nIn the week of the marathon, I only did 2 3ks and was very careful about my form (wider stance & more crouched down) and the sloping of the pavement. \n\nI figured my knee would act up at some point during the race, but I was hoping it would be at least after 10km of running. \nSome redditors told me to give up the marathon, but I am stubborn and decided to go for it anyway.\n\n### Pre-race\nI carb loaded 500gr carbs each day for the Thu-Fri-Sat before the race. It was my first time doing something like this, and I made the mistake of eating the last meals too late in the day, which I suspect messed with my sleep. I made sure to drink enough water, too, and stay away from fatty and fibrous foods.\n\nBy some miracle, I got almost 10 hours of sleep the night before the race, in the weird bike-themed hotel room I was staying in in Bruges. My sleep quality felt much better than it had the past 3 nights before, so I felt very relieved and excited in the morning.\n\nPre-race I ate: 1 ripe banana & 2 chocolate-oat TREK bars. (A bit more than what I would usually eat before my long runs).\n\nI had all my stuff prepped, including my mid-race food: 12x 25gr of carbs worth of dates, raisins, and dried figs. My husband jokes that I run with a whole charcuterie board.\n\nMy expectations to run the marathon under 5 hours had been crippled by my knee issue, so I was just happy if I'd be able to finish it at all. Leading up to the race, I had no idea how far I'd get and wanted to punch anyone kindly asking, \"Are you ready?\" or \"How are you feeling?\" in the nose. Needless to say, I was nervous!\nMy goal was to maintain a 7:30/km pace for as long as I could and re-evaluate at the 32km mark to maintain, slow down, or speed up. \n\n### Race\nI was in the last starting block with anyone planning to run the marathon in over 4h15 or the half marathon in over 2h11. \nMy husband, brother, and some friends were there to cheer me on with some fun signs, and I waved bye to them as our starting block was being guided to the start line. \n\n0km-5km: I was being taken over by everyone & their granny, but I managed to stick pretty close to my planned pace. However, after only 2km, I started already feeling some knee pain! I figured that I'd see how it felt in the first 5km. The pain came and went and I took the decision of \"fuck it, I'll just run this thing with the pain\". \n\n5km-10km: We made our way out of the city, and up towards a town in the north. We were running along the canal which was nice, and I was settling into my pace and tried to ignore the knee pain. I was relieved to see that the uneven cobblestones of Bruges had been replaced by a smooth bicycle path sloping in the right direction to reduce strain on my knee.\n\n10km-16km: probably the most enjoyable part of the race for me. The sun came out so I tucked my jacket into my running vest & whipped out my hat. The views were of pretty green pastures with sheep and horses. My knee wasn't hurting too bad at this point. \n\n16km-21km\nAround 17km I stopped for a short loo break.\nMy knee was hurting pretty bad in this section, and we were making our way back into Bruges so the roads were uneven again. But I knew my cheering squad was waiting at 21km so I was looking forward to seeing them.\n\n21km-25km\nHad a short pit stop where my friends handed me two fresh water flasks for my vest and enough snacks for the second part of the race, while my husband was rolling biofreeze all over my knees. \nI started up again and separated from all the people about to finish their half-marathon. As I went into the smaller street I realised I was entirely alone. \nAs I made my way through the center of Bruges I was cheered on my the half-marathoners who were proudly wearing their medals and even some super fast marathoners who had just finished.  I still had halfway to go, an felt a bit embarrassed to be running alone after being amidst such a big crowd before.\nHowever, I felt the biofreeze start to work and that gave me a bit of relief. I put a headphone in and listened to some music for extra motivation.  \nAt about 23km I saw a guy in front of me and was very happy to see another runner! After chatting with him for a bit, a policeman on a motorcycle came up to our level so I asked him how many were still behind us. He said \"two, but I don't think they're going to make it\". With that encouraging information I turned to my new running buddy and said \"at least we're still moving!\", only for him to get a bad cramp and stop 2 minutes later.. that was also a bit discouraging 😅\n\n25km-30km \nI was fighting my demons in this section. No one in sight, running along and above highways, dealing with ascents that were threatening to kill me. This section was mentally the hardest. \nThe music wasn't doing anything for me so I switched to my favourite podcast which provided some familiarity.  I knew that I was able to run until 32km because I had done it before, so I should push until then. \n\n30km-36km\nI had reached 30km and that was already farther than i thought I would get with my knee. I only had 2x 6km left with my group waiting at the 36km mark, so I started cheering myself up mentally by repeating a now very cringe mantra \"I am strong, I'm a sigma\" to drown out the negative thoughts. My body was hurting all over, not only my knee, and I was getting some cramps in my legs. One of the rare people along the course screamed \"you're a legend!\" so I added it to my  \"strong sigma\" mantra. \nI also ended up spotting and passing some other miserable souls and was somehow keeping my 7:30 pace.\nI had also increased the frequency of my snacking from every 30 minutes to every 20 minutes to avoid hitting the wall. The whole race felt like I was hitting the wall, so if it did happen I didn't notice at this point.\nAt 35km my brother popped up next to me on his bike, and gave me some solid encouragements which was nice.\n\n36km-42km\nShort pit stop at 32km with a new water flask and a fuck ton of biofreeze, and I hobbled away. \nWas making my way back into Bruges and realised that I'd passed about 10 people at this point, meaning I was no longer last. \nSaw a few people walking off and on so I wobbled past them too. \nOnly at the 40km did I know for sure I'd be able to finish this race. It had been painful from the 2km point, so what was 15 minutes more of pain? \nI was even able to increase my speed to sub 7:00/km for the last few because I wanted to be done faster and figured my legs couldn't possibly feel worse.\nFinally saw the finish line and heard cheering. I was so fucking happy it was over.\n\n### Post-race\nLimped past the gates to collect my freebies and medal, just to cry like a big ole wuss in my husband's arms. They kept we walking for a while to the bag drop-off point to collect my stuff and stretch a bit. \nI was mentally not there for a few hours after the race, but did enjoy a nice ham and ketchup sandwich (don't judge me) from the Panos. \nAfter our quest for a beer ended fruitless, we decided to hop on the train for the 3 hour journey to get back home.\nAt home I enjoyed a large pizza and a hot bath before hitting the sack. \n\nSlept like shit the first night since my whole body was in pain. \nMonday was also very uncomfortable,  I had a hard time walking and getting up&down stairs.\nTuesday (yesterday) felt better, but I was still limping.\nAs I am writing this, most of the body pain has subsided. Still slightly limping dur to my knee but the bodily discomfort is closer to what I felt after long runs during training.\n\nI just got my race pics in yesterday and I did a good job at smiling for the camera, so there are a few good ones! (And a few where I am visibly fighting my demons).\n\nI still cannot believe I actually finished it, it feels like a dream. I suffered basically the whole race, and don't think I'll run another marathon. \nProbably without the knee injury, I would have been able to enjoy it more.\n\nFor now, I plan on resting the rest of this week and going for a couple of short EZ runs next week while I think up my next challenge.\n\nI wanted this report to be as complete as possible so I have proof for my future self that I did, indeed, have a horrible time, bit I am extremely proud of myself. And to NOT DO IT AGAIN YOU IDIOT!! \n\nThank you for reading if you've made it this far. If you're interested in running your first marathon, here are some wiseish words: If I can run a marathon, you definitely can if you stay consistent.  Trust the training and see how far you're able to push yourself. It leads to a whole new form of respect for oneself that I had not anticipated. \nHave a lovely day! \n\nEdit: Grammar & typos\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

I used to run cross country and track in middle/high school so I did have some background. But I forgot how to pace myself and like many others who have come past their high school years, I’ve gained weight and gotten much slower. I at first had no training plan and foolishly thought that since I ran a 5k, I should just start running 4-5 miles right off the bat. That was a bad idea because I got an overuse injury in my Achilles. I went to the doctor, they prescribed me some meds and told me to lay off for a few weeks. \n\nIt wasn’t until 3 weeks later, in July that I began to run again. Things were good for all of two weeks before I started feeling my Achilles hurt again. This time, I did some research on things I could do to mitigate the issues and saw some exercises I could do for a few weeks while I healed again. I also ended up getting new shoes because originally I was using hokas with a 5mm heel to toe drop. I switched to brooks with a 10mm heel to toe drop and boy did that make a difference when I started running again in August. I decided to use Hal Higdons novice training schedule and went from there. My runs were no longer painful with my new shoes and I learned to slow down. I realized that I would never get anywhere if I was acting like I need to be in zone 20 to get there. I learned to stay around zone 3 which still felt easy for me although it wasn’t zone 2 and worked on breathing through my nose more. \n\nBy September I was now into 4-5 mile short runs with 7-9 mile long runs. I started feeling like I could really do a half when I got to 7 miles and still felt like I could keep going. For all my training I ran 14 minute miles and kept it easy. A week before my half I also ended up going on a hiking trip where it was all steep inclines for 12 mile hikes. I started tapering 4 days before the race (mostly because I was still kinda sore from the hikes). \n\n### Pre-race\nI live locally but my family did make a 5 hour drive the night before just to watch me which was amazing of them. I ate some yogurt and drank water before the race but that was about it. I packed gus and used the bathroom like 10 minutes before it was my heat’s turn. I stretched for only 5 minutes because I was running late but still got a good warmup in. I also realized I forgot my watch but I was able to pull up Strava to track.\n\n### Race\nMiles 1-3 I had originally met up with a friend so at first was running with her. We both said we were aiming for sub 3 but I knew right off the bat we were going too fast. Since I didn’t have my watch I was looking for the pacers but realized we had gone 3 heats ahead of them so I was on my own. Luckily my Strava tracked my pace though. After mile 1, I let my friend pass me and kept it steady at 12:30 although I really wanted to go faster. I updated my family and friends through text every time I passed a mile. The weather was humid but still cool and after I passed mile 3, I was still feeling great.\n\nMiles 3-7 wow these miles absolutely flew by I couldn’t believe it. Normally in training I had to take a break around 3-4 miles but I hadn’t stopped at all and I was able to maintain the 12:30 pace thus far. I took my first gu at 45 minutes (mile 3) and it tasted like pure caramel sauce which I hated. We ended up running up a couple inclines here as well which kinda killed me but I didn’t let up. I kept going with the support of random strangers cheering and my music. I found my family at mile 6, and that gave me another boost. I was still feeling good getting to mile 7.\n\nMiles 7-10 at mile 7 I ended up catching up to the friend who passed me before and she was really in the pain cave. In that moment I was so grateful to myself for not letting myself go faster before because I could tell she was struggling to keep going. I ended up passing her (although I kept checking her location to make sure she was okay) and kept on going. I repeated mantras like “you got this. Running is mental. You have so much left in you.” I took another gu at mile 9 and hated it again. I’m honestly not sure the ones I used made a difference but who knows. At mile 10, I started to feel the mental game starting.\n\nMiles 10-13 Now I realize that 12 minutes a mile is still slow but I was already getting emotional with how well I was doing! I was STILL maintaining the 12:30 pace at mile 10. I took advantage of any water stations I saw and started interacting with the crowd more to boost myself. I kept repeating my mantras although I didn’t enter the pain cave until mile 11. I still didn’t let up on pace. I really, really, REALLY wanted to stop and walk at mile 12 but I didn’t let myself. I reminded myself again that running is mental and I still have 40% more left in me. By mile 13 everyone’s cheers made me feel like I was flying. At the home stretch the adrenaline jolted into me and I sprinted towards the finish. My family and dog cheered me on as I passed through.\n\n### Post-race\nI immediately wanted to cry realizing I had just kept up a minute and a half faster pace for almost every mile that I ran. All I wanted was to finish, and I got so much more than that. I got my medal and lots of free snacks at the finish which was nice. I paid the most attention to the free banana and chocolate milk they gave me. Then I met up with my family and dog where I burst into tears. I told them I couldn’t believe I did it, and how fast it went by. I thought the race would feel so long and it ended up going by so fast. It was such a wild ride and I was just so grateful, and still am. We went to have some delicious breakfast at my favorite spot after. I had coffee, eggs, bacon, and pancakes. I made sure to stretch as soon as I got home and took a nice long shower. I iced my feet because they hurt pretty bad and started thinking about what I’ll be working on next (probably speed work). Now, predictably, I’m thinking about the next race. Also getting kind of delusional on how much I’m able to speed up next time. Guess delusions come with the territory. \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

I'm a big overweight and have had a tough year mentally. My daughter was born with serious health issues and I've struggled with that quite a bit. Sadly, one of my coping mechanisms is eating. Luckily, running does help as well! \n\nI've started running somewhere at the end of 2019. I wasn't super consistent with it, but did a few races; and before this my longest run was 11 km. \n\nAs a kid, my dad was a pretty good runner. I frequently joined him (on my bike) during his training runs and cheered him on during his races. I vividly remember being there when he ran his half marathon (1:31:41 - he was quick!). His ambition was to run a full marathon one day, sadly he passed away a few years later due to ALS.  \n\nGrowing up, I always wanted to run a half marathon, to honor him. And last Sunday, I did. \n\n### Training\n\nPart 1: \n\nI started my plan with Runna in April, which in hindsight probably was a bit of a mistake. The build up now seems too long. in May I bought new running shoes (Hoka Gaviota 5) and they gave me knee pain, something which I've never had while running. I reverted back to my old shoes, but the pain drained my motivation and I took the whole month of June off. \n\nPart 2: \n\nBeginning of July, I did a short 3k run to see if I was still in pain. I wasn't! And I had bought the newer version of my old shoes (ASICS Gel Persue 9) so I wouldn't encounter the same issue again. I did a few shorter runs with the Hoka's, so I wouldn't feel too guilty about all the money I have spent on shoes. \n\nI decided to start a new Runna plan as well, since I had lost quite a bit of fitness in that month off. And it gave me 14 weeks before race day, which I thought was manageable. \n\nTraining was 3 runs a week, an easy run, a tempo and a long run. Before week 10 I had only missed a single run, however on week 11 I felt sick (probably had covid) and skipped 2 runs and then tried to go for my long run: 18k. However, after 6k I felt really ill (including vomiting) so I stopped and walked home, disappointed. \n\nI did do my 18k the week after though, and it went really well. \n\n### Pre-Race\n\nMy wife and I decided to make a weekend out of, so we arrived the day before and walked a bit through the beautiful city that is Bruges. Slightly more than I wanted to walk the day before, but nothing excessive. \n\nDay off had a nice breakfast in our B&B and walked to the starting line. Got into the last wave (+ 2:10), and the DJ kept us entertained while we waited to start. The first runners were off at 10 AM, we however, only started almost a half hour late. I had already taken a gell just before 10 AM, so that felt a bit wasted. \n\n### Race\n\nFinally we went off, and I had planned on staying with the 2:30 pacer team. Tried to stick with them, however I felt they went slightly too quick (around 5-10 seconds too quick) so I let them go and tried to find my own rhythm. At the 4k mark I started feeling a bit strange, lightheaded and my legs felt cold. I seriously considered stopping there, but convinced myself that it would be temporary. By 5k I felt better and my wife was cheering for me and even running a few metres with me at the cheering zone. That really gave me a good boost! \n\nThe next few k's were pretty uneventful. I found a nice couple of people who were running my pace and settled in. This was a long stretch by a canal to the next town over, and it was gorgeous. I felt good, my pace was on point. All was well... until the 12k mark.\n\nI'm still not quite sure what happened there, but I hit a massive wall. My Achilles heel started aching pretty bad, something which had never happened during training. I started run/walking to try to keep something of pace, and hoping I would pull through, but it never happened. Mentally it was pretty tough, but I was determined to get to the finish line. \n\nJust before the last k, a super friendly runner passed me while I was walking and he told me I wasn't allowed to walk, and we would go to the finish together. On the way we picked up another runner and she joined us as well. My wife was just before the finish line and screamed her lungs out. That felt really great as well :) \n\nRan over the finish in 2:43:31 (strava time 2:42:22). \n\n### Post-Race\n\nCollected my (beautiful) medal and thanked the guy who helped me the last K, and then saw my wife again, who said she was so proud of me. \n\nI was overwhelmed by emotions and just started crying. It came over me. Having finished, thinking of my dad, thinking of my daughter. \n\nShe helped me pull it together and then we walked to pick up my stuff, eat something and went home. \n\nStill not quite sure what happened at 12k, but perhaps I was a bit under trained. Odd that the 18k in training went so much better, and at my intended race pace even. I'm not super disappointed in my time, but I would love to break 2:30 next time. \n\nI'm not finished with half marathon races though. I really want to run this one again, and maybe in March run the one in Ghent? Got 2 10k races planned before the year is over so I'll take a week off healing (ouch, huge blisters) and then get back into it! \n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

I wasn't running much, eating poorly, not sleeping, and was stressed. Babies will do that to you, I suppose. But we found a deal at Sam's Club on an exercise bike that my wife wanted to get, and then a great deal on a treadmill popped up too, and having the low barrier of those in our garage really helped us get back on track. A buddy of mine wanted to do some races together, the only one of which we actually did was a relay marathon, but that encouragement also helped me put more mileage in over the spring. I lost some momentum over the summer with a ridiculous work schedule, but have felt pretty good since September or so.\n\nMy big problem was that I wasn't getting the distance back. I had some fast runs, I had some great runs, but I never had any real *long* runs. I signed up for this race two weeks ago, mostly because it went literally through my backyard and it seemed too convenient not to do it. But I hadn't run over 10 miles in a few years, so I was genuinely concerned about a half.\n\nOn Tuesday, I bought new shoes out of necessity. I ended up with some Saucony Kinvaras, which are an actual dream. So light, but it feels so cushioned. I had a frustrating work call on my way back from the running store, so I stopped in a neighborhood and started running. I ended up doing 10.25 in a very quick pace, and felt great after, which gave me a lot of confidence.\n\n### Pre-race\nSince sleep is a rare commodity in our house right now, I set my alarm and went to bed on the couch, hoping I could get up early and sneak out without waking my wife or kids. Sadly, the baby cried basically all night long and no one got much sleep. I had set out my standard cereal, but more than usual (muesli, bran flake, almonds, various seeds), put a coffee in the microwave, and slept in my racing clothes so I could make the morning go as fast as possible. So at least that went in my favor.\n\nParking downtown is free on Saturdays, and I work right by the park where the race began and ended, so it was low-stress getting in. I picked up my bib and did some light dynamic stretching while trying sort out my running playlist. I had accidentally put in a podcast that I already listened to (Welcome to Night Vale) and was trying to remove it, but my watch only syncs music on WiFi, so I was stuck with it. So I turned it on before the race to get it out of the way, listening to Cecil talk about the town for a second time that week.\n\nAs we lined up, I tried to find out who was running at what pace. I knew the beginning of the route was a fairly narrow path, so I wanted to be able to spread out early. Looking at past years, there were usually a handful of sub-90s, with one or two sub-80, and I figured I could keep up with them just for the first mile to get a good space between folks. But no one seemed very committal about pacing, so I ended up right in the front. \n\n### Race\nWhen the race started, one guy went out *hard.* Like, comically hard. He was sprinting, but with, shall we say, interesting form. After half a mile, I caught up to him and he seemed gassed already. And that, shockingly, left me in first, a position did not anticipate. I figured others must be right behind me, and would soon pass, but as we started nearing the second mile I realized that if anyone was planning to run a sub 80 they'd be well ahead by now. And, if anyone was planning to run sub 85, they would need to be ahead of my pace as well. \n\nThe first turn is about 5k into the race, at which point I felt like I was running completely alone. I wondered if there was something wrong, like I had missed something major, but the guy at the turn just cheered me on. That episode of Night Vale came on for a THIRD time, so I was graced with Cecil Baldwin yet again. I looped around a small lake where my family often plays, then went up into the neighborhood across from my own. I knew this was a deceptively large hill, with the first rise going for .6 miles and a second hill for .4 after, so again I expected someone to pass me there. But I kept enough momentum to keep my pace decent, and managed to regain the speed quickly as we passed into my actual neighborhood.\n\nI live behind a nature preserve with a beautiful paved trail separating my backyard from the wildnerness, which is where we ran. [I had made some fun chalk signs](https://imgur.com/a/683VBlg) with my older kid the day before, included a big spider on a web telling people to not take the path into the road but to continue on the path to the right (later, my wife told me she heard several runners missed the chalk and the race had failed to put a sign there, the only oversight on the course, so they weren't happy). Since my yard was right there, I stashed a squeeze bottle of salted gatorade on a post to grab, and my family was out with noise makers and signs. They, and I, were shocked that I was in first at that point, since we were at the halfway point. I threw the bottle in my neighbor's yard and tried to get some speed, as I knew this section super intimately and wanted to maximize the downhill.\n\nGoing through the neighborhood was a little sad, as no one was out supporting. Plus, it was hilly. But I got back to the main road and prepped to turn, only to be waylaid by a fire truck. It only added a few steps to around them, but I had to basically direct traffic for myself as the guy in the intersection didn't know what to do. Then I hit the 'viking ship,' which is a run I've been doing where I run down a steep hill and up the equally steep backside, then turn around and do it all again and again. I made it across the valley and turned back to the path back to the start for the final 5k, still expecting someone to pass me.\n\nWhen I go to mile 10, and the straight path back (with lots of morning runners and the 10k racers), I wanted to win. But the second I started to think 'I'm gonna do this!' I also started thinking, 'but what if someone passes you right at the end? Won't that hurt so much worse? You should slow down and let someone pass now so you don't feel so bad at the end.' What a dumb, intrusive thought! Not being accustomed to winning anything, this was a real mind trip for me.\n\nFor the last three miles, I fought that weird thought, plus my toes started to feel like I was losing a toenail, plus my right hamstring started to feel a little crampy, but I didn't want to waste this opportunity to finally win a real race. I didn't have the energy to really push any pace for the last two miles, but I was able to coast in with a reasonably strong finish. I nearly collapsed at the line, but overall felt pretty dang great!  \n\n### Post-race\nThis was a smaller race to begin with, and the group hosting it was pretty minimal and chill. There was some music, a massage table (a true godsend for that right hammy), and lots of relaxed cheering. Had a banana and a biscuit, plus some gatorade while I waited around to make sure I didn't miss being honored; I've placed in my age group before, but never in the overall, and finally headed home.\n\nVery silly choice, but I offered to camp with my toddler in the backyard that night, so I got no sleep for the second straight night. Sunday is a big work day (I'm a minister), so this weekend was *a lot.* Plus, this morning, a staff member publcially resigned without informing us, so I'm taking some much needed time to be distracted and ignore reality for a little bit (sorry for the length...).\n\nI think I'll lose two toenails, but otherwise no big issues. Totally worth it.\n\n[Is this what the kids means when they say \"full send'?](https://imgur.com/a/CE7xjXM)\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

In the beginning of July, I competed in Challenge Roth and my body was completely battered by the race - which delay the start of my training block for Köln. To train for this HM, I decided to follow one of the Garmin HM plans. For some reason, I could not figure out how to set the plan up for a 12-week period, and had to modify the plan based on the 16-week plan the app produced - this is a note to self that for the next race, I will try to choose a more accurate and curated plan based on time and needs. \n\n\nAnyway, for this training block I made a conscious effort to *try* to keep my long runs, slow. I also put a lot of emphasis on interval and tempo training every week. I ran quite a lot of runs with a friend that was also training for the full in Berlin, and we would go out to the track once a week for speed training and ran long runs on the weekend with each other as well. It really helped keep us both accountable training for each of our respective races. For shoes, I ran most of the easy runs in Novablast 3s, tempo and interval training in Boston 12s, and a couple of long runs in my race-day shoes - New Balance Supercomp Elite V3. \n\nNow, what I say next is, admittedly, not the smartest thing I could have done during training. I felt like I was in the best running shape of my life - lost about 7,5 kilos since July, through a mix of eating healthier, being much more physically active, and giving up drinking completely for about 5 months now. Because of this, I did not take many rest days. I actually wound of running about 5 or 6 days each week, averaging about 45-60 km per week during the training period. It was quite odd, I just had the feeling where I NEEDED to go for a run and my day did not feel complete unless I went for a run. Unfortunately, I wound up catching a cold twice during the training block, and had family visit me, which cut about 2 weeks out from the training block. Because of these \"lost\" days, I did not think I would be able to hit my goal time of 1:45. \n\n### Pre-race\nThe nerves affected me terribly the day and night before the race. Slept a total of about 3.5 hours, but I anticipated this and slept for about 8 hours the night before. Made myself the usual pre-race breakfast: oatmeal with honey, cinnamon, and a banana a bottle of water, and a bottle of Powerade for the way to the race start. \n\nThe morning was COLD. It was around 6 or 7 degrees celcius race morning. I was debating weather or not to race in warm clothes, but ultimately decided on race shorts and a singlet. I would just wear an old hoody and abandon it before the start of the race. I then headed out of my apartment, took a quick 15 minute bike ride to the bag drop off zone, which served to be a nice warm up to get the body moving. The benefit of this race, is that it is my \"home race\" and I can be home within 15 or 20 minutes post-race. \n\nThis is my third year participating in the half marathon and it blows my mind how much it had grown in size. There were a total of 30,500 runners between the half-marathon, full-marathon, and relays. There were not enough portable toilets and the lines were massive. There was also a large amount of people trying to get into their starting blocks - I had to jump over one of the barriers to get into position. I got into place, and waited for the countdown to start. \n\n\n### Race\nDespite the cold start, the conditions were perfect for a race. Sunny, light wind, and no rain. There was so much congestion at the start that I was not able to fall into a comfortable pace for the first 3 kilometers. There was a lot of weaving involved, unfortunately. Before the start of the race, I was convinced that I would be happy with just beating my previous PR of 1:55:27, due to the lost weeks of training. I don't know if it was the adrenaline, or the excitement of the crowds, but my body was pushing out a pace I did not think I would be able to keep up. Usually, I would be passed by countless numbers of runners, but during the race, I was passing a lot of people and this proved to be a huge, huge ego boost. \n\nDuring training, I had also practiced with drinking a minimal amount of water during the long runs so that I would be not have to stop at every aid station like I usually do. For this race, I stopped at the third and fifth aid stations for water. As for nutrition, I had two cola-flavored power gels after 45 minutes and one hour and 15 minutes. I know I will sound like a broken record, but the support from the crowd was another aspect that helped keep moving forward. The crowd was the best as you crossed through Ehrenfeld, Friesenplatz, and Rudolfplatz. \n\nI hit the dreaded wall around 19,5 kilometers in. I looked down at my watch and there was a *slight* possibility that I could hit my goal time. As I tried to push harder, my left quad started to cramp and I had to slow down significantly. The finish line was so close, but those last kilometers were a mental struggle. I saw my friends around kilometer 20 and that gave me that final burst of energy to try to finish as strong as possible. As I saw the red carpet and finish line, I gave everything I had for a final sprint finish. And the finish line is incredible - finishing right near the Köln Cathedral. \n \n\n### Post-race\nI ended having my best half-marathon race of my life - ending with a time of 1:46:57! Although I didn't hit my goal time, I am still very happy with the performance. After I looked at my Strava data, I saw that I had PR'd in the 5K, 10K, 15K, 10-mile, and half marathon.\n\nMy previous times for this race were: 2:26:44 in 2022, and 2:01:09 in 2023. It was really fun to run through all of the different veedels and have people cheering from their balconies and all across the roads. My only major complaint is that this year, the location of the bag drops was changed and there were no clear signs post-race. So a lot of us had to walk around and try to reorient ourselves. Had to walk about 15 minutes in the cold, wearing wet, sweaty clothes. Overall, I am very happy with my time and can't wait to continue improving! \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "**Background**\n\nI had planned to run my first backyard ultra in the spring of 2023 followed by a 200-miler in the fall. That training was going pretty well until my whole world got upended in January 2023 when I had a stroke.  Woke up one morning with a numb arm (“Must have slept on it wrong.”).  Next, I noticed a bit of weirdness with one side of my face as I was brushing my teeth (“This can’t be a stroke.  That couldn’t happen to me.  See, arm and face are back to normal.”).  Then I went to tell my kids goodbye before I left for work…and couldn’t speak.  I could think of the words, but couldn’t get my mouth to form them.  Yep, time to go to the ER.\n\nThree days in the hospital, numerous tests, sooo many doctors, but no real info except that they found evidence of a stroke (and possible evidence of a previous one).  They weren’t sure of the cause as I had no other contributing factors, but were fairly confident it was from a PFO (patent foramen ovale).  A hole between the atria of my heart let a small blood clot bypass my lungs and go to my brain.  Fortunately, the stroke I had was very mild and the symptoms resolved within a day (difficulty forming words and some slight weakness on one side).  I was able to go home as they scheduled more tests to get a firm confirmation of the PFO.\n\nAny training was out the window now, but I was able to still get some slight running in as I waited for more tests.  In February, I was able to get an echocardiogram that confirmed the PFO.  This is something everyone is born with.  The PFO allows blood to circulate in the womb, but it is supposed to close as you grow older.  For 1 in 4, it doesn’t close completely and I was one of the unlucky ones.  Considering the alternative causes for the stroke, this was pretty fortunate as it can be treated with out-patient heart surgery.  Yes, that’s correct, out-patient heart surgery.  The other likely culprit was atrial fibrillation which would have meant a lifetime on blood thinners.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t get the surgery until April so still only light running (3 mile runs, 15-21 mpw).  The surgery went great.  They passed a camera up the vein from one leg and a plug up the other and it was done.  No running for a week, light running 3 weeks, then back to training.  Building back was tough, but I took it slow over May, June, and July to get my mileage back to 40-50 mpw.  No real workouts, just getting in mileage.  I kept building mileage and half-heartedly did a marathon plan for a race in November, but without a lot of good training, it ended up being more of a training run. So, not a great year, but I had at least built my base back up to be ready for ultra training for the races in 2024.\n\n____\n\n**Training**\n\nI’ve had good luck with Koop’s training format from *Training Essentials for Ultrarunning* so I went with this again.  I used his Beginner’s 100 miler plan (which is pretty insane for a beginner’s plan) as a starting point and tweaked it as needed.  My plan was to get some high mileage in with the main focus being back-to-back long runs and then try and get as much of the faster run Koop prescribes (intervals, tempos, steady state runs).  He has a lot in his plans, but I dropped those as needed.\n\nMy goal race for the spring was Eternal Damnation Backyard Ultra.  This was my first backyard ultra and on a fairly tough course (mountain bike trails with 250-ish feet per loop).  Koop recommends training time per week for a 100k to 100-miler to be at 9 hours per week for 6 weeks starting at 9 weeks before race.  I averaged 64 mpw for this training cycle, with 13:01 hours of training per week.  The race went fairly well with me completing 17 yards for 70.8 miles.  I had hoped for more, but the terrain got to me as well as some lingering metatarsal discomfort that I was still working through.\nAfter a recovery week, I eased back into training again following the same plan again although slightly abbreviated to allow for recovery.  I dropped some of the interval quality weeks and just focused on building miles again.  I added in some races too which forced me to change things around a bit.\n\nTraining through the summer was challenging, I certainly did not get as much of the quality speed runs in, but again, my focus was overall mileage and back-to-back long runs.  I worked my race run/walk strategy into almost all of the longs runs as well as race hydration/fueling.  One of my planned races was a 24-hour track race in June so I worked on heat training by doing some runs in the afternoon and most of the long runs leading up to that race on a track.\n\n*KUS Mini Race Report*\n\n24-hour track race on Wednesday which is strange day of the week for a race, but was chosen for a reason.  This is the [Kansas Ultrarunners Society (KUS) 6/12/24 hour race]( https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=110967) which is normally held in November on a 2.1 mile trail-ish loop.  The RD couldn’t pass up the opportunity to have the race on 6/12/24 this year and decided to try a track race as he had been requests for it.   \n\nI really enjoyed this format although the heat did a number on everyone.  As expected, it can be hot in June in KS and the temps hit mid-90’s.  I planned to use this as a test for the 200-miler and employ a similar walk/run strategy.  All-in-all, the race went well, at least through the first 12 hours.  I was able to stay on race strategy with pace and fueling through about 8 hours (40 mi) then the heat became brutal.  Slowed things down and focused on heat management with ice and water on my head, but the constant water and sweat was causing some serious chafing and waterlogged shoes by 12 hours (~60 miles).  Took a 45 minute break to change clothes and dry and retape my feet.  By the time, I got moving again, my legs had tightened up quite a bit and my quads were pretty sore.  I worked to get moving again, but ended up with a lot of walking and couldn’t quite get resettled from the heat.  I ended up calling at 16:26 hours with 71.3 miles. \nAlthough I was not happy with the result based on how I could have done with current training, I was content with the result considering the conditions.  It was a good test of a lot of things for the 200-miler.  Gear choice was good and would have been fine except all the added water from dousing myself.  Nutrition and hydration went great.  I have also been dealing with some forefoot issues on longer training runs (sometimes popping up after 10 miles), but have added metatarsal pads to my insoles recently.  I had no foot issues (other than being waterlogged) for the entire race.  I tried taping my feet for the first time in a race and that worked great.  No blisters or hot spots at all.  Run walk strategy worked good and gave me some data to try and optimize that as well.  Finally, it was great to try this race on a track.  I really enjoyed the format and very much want to try it again, but in better temps.  The RD posted the next day that he went back to the track when the temps were similar to the high on race day and measured the track temp at 116 F.  Woof!\n\n*Back to training*\n\nAfter a recovery week and easy week to get back into training, it was time to get into the meat of the plan and focus on mileage and race conditions.  I never hit my weeks as planned, but felt like I got the bulk of what I needed to each week.  Another goal on this cycle was to stay up on supplemental work including Myrtl routine (3/wk), yoga (1/wk), and a core/strength routine (2/wk).  I was able to do this for most of the cycle as well as get a trail run with the local running group in once a week.  This also included a great group run with the group from one town to the next for 35 miles.  I used it as another race test with similar nutrition and walk/run pacing.  Tough run, but great group of people to do it with.  Six weeks before the race, I planned a tune-up race to really help test out everything.\n\n*NIGHT TRAIN Mini Race Report*\n\nNight Train is a very small, timed race on a rails trail (3, 6, and 12 hour options).  The course is a 2.5 mi out and back on the rail trail (although they misplaced the cone so each lap was 5.4 miles).  Plan was to mimic Cowboy course stations and only stop to refill bottles every 10 miles (2 loops) and aid station stops every 20 miles (4 loops).  I was shooting for 60 miles over the 12 hours, so average moving pace (with walk breaks) of 11:30/mi to allow some AS time.  Run comfortable for 0.4 mi at around 10:00/pace, quick walk for 0.1mi.  Fluids every 0.5 mi, nutrition every 2.5 mi, heavier solid food at AS breaks.  Rinse and repeat.  At first, I really tried to pay attention to my run but eventually started going with what was comfortable and it was good not to stress over it much.  Sometimes it was 9:45, sometimes 10:45, but typically in the 10-10:15 range.  As long as the mile splits were close to 11:30, I wasn’t concerning myself about it.\nTemps got much more comfortable as midnight approached (race start was upper 70’s) and really had no issue with the heat.  Everything was still going well through 40 miles.  Besides the general fatigue, no physical problems.  Feet were good, stomach was good, energy levels good.  45-ish miles things were getting a bit more difficult.  Nothing major, just needed to focused more on my pattern.  Sunrise gave me a bit of a a great second wind.  I was still running the run sections by feel, but when I looked at my watch I kept seeing paces closer to 9:15 rather than the usual 10:15.  :shrug:  Just keep grinding.  Came back to the finish for the last time with 2 minutes to spare for 60.4 miles, 1st place, and a course record.  All in all, it was a great practice run and everything went great.  I did see where I need to tweak a few things for the big race, but I was very happy how this one turned out.  I was able to keep the loops very consistent and minimized time at each AS stop.\n\nLoops: 1:01:03, 1:01:31, 1:01:03, 1:02:09, 1:02.34, 1:04:16, 1:03:31, 1:01:44, 1:03:02, 1:02:16, 1:02:14, 13:18\n\nAS: 4:49, 5:09, 1:23, 4:46, 3:29\n\n*Last weeks of training*\n\nRecovery from the race was probably the best yet and I was able to get back to training quicker.  I wanted a couple of more big mileage/time weeks before tapering down for Cowboy.  I also worked to add in more walking (not counted in my mileage) to work those muscles too, especially over the taper weeks as I decreased mileage.  I was able to add in 10-12 miles of walking on those first 2 taper weeks.\n\n*Weekly mileage progression*\n\n40, 54, 63, 70, 74, 30, 83 (KUS), 40, 60, 70, 75, 50, 55, 81 (NT), 52, 79, 68, 55, 33.7, 215 (Average = 67)\n\nAvg weekly run time for 6 wks before taper = 11:46\n\n\n\n*Conclusions from Training Plan*\n\nAlthough I wish I did not have to drop so much of the quicker miles during training, I felt good with the volume I did run.  I had consistent back-to-back runs of 20 to 24 miles as well as a couple of good long race efforts to practice.  I was also happy with being fairly consistent with the supplemental work and the added strength/core routine felt good.\n\n____________\n\n**THE RACE**\n\n[The Cowboy 200]( https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=10885) is a point-to-point foot race along the Cowboy Trail (converted rail trail) winding through many small towns in Nebraska with [views]( https://imgur.com/tz5VKxe) of pastures, fields, and more than 200 bridges in total, with the largest being 1/4 mile long and 148 feet high.  It starts in Norfolk, NE and ends in Valentine, NE with 11 manned ais stations and 8 water stops along the way.  This looked a great option for me as a way to try out the 200-mile distance without having to worry about technical trails or high altitude.  Both of which are hard to train for as a Kansas flatlander.  Plus, I like fast and flat ultras.\n\n*Fueling*\n\nPlan was 300-ish calories per hour with about 150 cal in my bottle (Proxima-C) and some solid food every 30 minutes (applesauce, baby food, Naak purees) during a walk break, and then water as needed.  I planned to get more substantial solid food at manned aid stations (~100-200 cal each time).\n\n*Goals heading into race day:*\n\nI typically set aggressive goals and this one was no different.  I planned to start out with the goal of average moving pace of 12:00/mile.  Later in the race as fatigue sets in, the goal was to keep overall race pace to 14:20-ish/mile for a 48-hour finish.  Considering this was my first time running something like this, I had no idea if that was feasible, but I wanted to have something to target.\n\n___\n\n**Race Day**\n\nUp at 4 am to get ready for the 6 am start.  Fueled up with Pop Tarts and a Mt Dew, breakfast of champions!  I tape my feet, get dressed, and check all my gear, then time to head to the start line.  Once there, got my GPS tracker, spoke to a couple of runners I knew who were also running, and then get lubed up in the needed areas (thank you, Squirrel’s Nut Butter!).  Temperatures are nice, but I know it will be getting warm later.  I plan to wear a long sleeve sun hoodie for the day knowing how well it can keep me cool.  Short pre-race talk, line up at the arch, and we’re off into the darkness!\n\n*Start Line (Fri, 6:00)*\n\nPeople separate out fairly quick and I settle into my pace strategy, trying not to let the race energy sweep me along too fast.  I still end up running a bit too quick, but enjoy the excitement of starting this long trek.  Once out of town and off the paved section, we get on the crushed gravel trail and settle into fields, pastures, and open space.  I enjoy the [sunrise as it comes up](https://imgur.com/vV4WJca) and focus on not getting behind on fueling.\n\n*Battle Creek (manned), 10 miles (Fri, 7:58)*\n\nThe first aid station is a manned station and since it is so close to the start, I had my wife skip so she could enjoy a bit more time in the hotel.  [I roll in quickly](https://imgur.com/wKoTvaj), refill bottles, grab a snack, and head out again in less than a minute.\n\nNot much to report through this section.  It’s still early, so legs feeling good.  Sun hasn’t gotten up much, so temps are still feeling good.  Just enjoying the quiet and [open country]( https://imgur.com/rOPogZW).\n\n*Meadow Grove (water), 17.1 miles (Fri, 9:25)*\n\nQuick water refill and keep on running.  Although it is not too warm yet, the plan is to refill any bottles with water to make sure I have plenty of fluids.  It’s a short stretch to the next manned AS and the chance to see my wife again.\n\n*Tilden (manned), 22.4 miles (Fri, 10:36)*\n\nTemps are not too bad, but I can tell it’s going to start getting warm soon.  I take a bit of time here to go to the bathroom, reapply lube, get some ice for my bandana, and grab half of PB&J sandwich, on top of refilling bottles for the next stretch.  I’m trying to drink one bottle of Proxima-C every hour plus some water as needed.  Grab the food I need for the next section and [get back on the trail]( https://imgur.com/zP9x2LR) with about 9 minutes spent in the AS.\n\nStill no issues.  Run, walk, drink, eat, repeat.  The ice bandana felt great, but just didn’t last as long as I would have liked.\n\n*Oakdale (water), 29.7 miles (Fri, 12:03)*\n\nQuick stop for water and keep on grinding.  It’s time for the first reroute off the trail due to downed bridges.  I catchup to several groups of runners here and chat a bit as I roll past.  We’re on to some rolling paved roads so I try to stay with my planned walk breaks, but mostly just walk the uphills and run where I can. It’s getting warm and the heat is reflecting off the asphalt pretty fierce.  Still staying up on eating and drinking and start taking in more water here.  Last stretch of the reroute was onto a unpaved road which got me excited until I realized it was going to be sand.  That was tough and made these miles kind of tough.  I passed some confused cows along the way who were wondering who all these weirdos running by were.\n\n*Neligh (manned), 38.2 miles (Fri, 13:45)*\n\n[Crossed the old train bridge](https://imgur.com/qxO2Coh) into Neligh to see my wife and get resupplied and reset for the next section.  This was going to one of the toughest of the course.  16 miles to the next water stop and 26 miles until the next manned AS, all during the hottest part of the day.  I loaded up with more ice, added in a handheld with water as well as a small bottle of water I could throw away later.  7 min in the AS, then back on the trail.\n\nStill running by myself, which I am used to and don’t mind so much.  I’ve been listening to some music when I wanted or just zone out and enjoy the quiet.  Unfortunately, in this section I somehow turned the brightness on my phone to 0% making it impossible to see the screen enough to use.  And since it was so bright, there was no way to fix it.  This section had the second long reroute which started on a winding gravel road, reminding me of my usual routes at home.  It was so windy though, I really wanted to check the course GPX on my phone, but just had to hope there were enough course markings.\nLuckily enough, the course was marked well enough for me to keep going.  It was getting really hot at this point and my legs were starting to feel the effort of running 50 miles to that point.  We’re back on paved road again and just baking from the sun above and the pavement below.  Stomach is not feeling great but still able to keep eating.  I’ve slowed my pace down for the heat and just concentrate on getting to the water stop.  Once there, it will only be 10 miles until the manned section.\n\n*Clearwater (water), 54.5 miles (Fri 17:42)*\n\nOnce back on the trail, it’s a short stretch to the water stop with amazingly cold water.  I refill water, mix up some Tailwind to get me to the next AS and get back to it after about 5 minutes at the water stop.  I’m through the worst part and the sun going down really helps cool things off.  I catch [the first sunset of the race](https://imgur.com/9pZ7u0f) and look forward to getting to the manned AS to have a rest.\n\n*Ewing (manned), 64.3 miles (Fri, 20:03)*\n\nGot to this AS in the dark, but it was a sight for sore eyes.  The last stretch had been rough, but I looked forward to seeing my wife and taking a break.  I took the opportunity here to change shoes and address a hot spot on my back.  My race vest had a seam that was curled over and rubbed on my lower back.  To avoid any chafing, etc., I had put a large bandage on that spot to protect it, but it wasn’t quite in the right spot.  We added a few more as a precaution.  I took a moment to sit and get off my feet as well as get some warm broth in.  It was amazing.  I was also able to finally fix my phone screen. Hallelujah! I also changed into a t-shirt for the night section.  After about 40 minutes, it was time to load up again and hit the trail with a brat to go.\n\n*Inman (water), 77.6 miles (Fri, 23:59)*\n\nWith the cooler temps, I was able to get back to a good run/walk rhythm and cruise along listening to music and podcasts.  A quick one minute stop in at the water stop to refill, then keep on motorin’.\n\n*O’Neill (manned), 85.4 miles (Sat, 2:02)*\n\nThe As was another welcome sight after a long stretch between crew.  This was going to be the last time seeing my wife for awhile as I was having her skip the next AS since I wanted her to get some rest after getting here so late (close to 2 am).  The next manned AS (Stuart) had no crew access so it was going to be about 12 hours before I could see her again.\nTook a few minutes to sit and rest my feet.  Bathroom break, reapply lube, and repack my food for the next leg.  I changed back into a sun shirt since it woud be afternoon before I saw crew again and I knew I was going to need it.  [Starting to get tired and sleepy](https://imgur.com/dc5sjO4) so downed a Redbull and took some chocolate covered espresso beans to go.  After about 20 minutes, it was time to get going again.\n\n*Emmett (water), 93.6 miles (Sat, 4:34)*\n\nThis was a lonely stretch, but I enjoyed the dark and the stars.  No real issues, just cruising along maintaining pace.  Average pace had sped up from the afternoon, but as fatigue set in, I was increasing my walk breaks some as well as having a slower running pace.  I was still on target for 100 miles in 24 hours so I was content.  Crossed 100 miles in about 24:08 as [the sun came up again]( https://imgur.com/6qKmcLI).\n\n*Atkinson (manned), 103.9 miles (Sat, 7:13)*\n\nAtkinson AS was where the 100-milers were starting in about an hour so lots of activity.  Same routine: bathroom, lube, sit a bit, eat, reload, and get back on the trail.  Spent about 20 minutes here and had some wonderful hashbrowns and sausage.\n\n*Stuart (manned), 113.9 miles (Sat, 10:30)*\n\nIt was a short jump to the next manned AS (10 miles), but no crew.  I had planned for this with my drop bag.  Made good time here and was running fairly well, but it was starting to get warm already.  Took a bit longer to make sure I had a rest and got some food.  By this time, the faster 100-milers were coming through.\n\n*Newport (water), 123.7 miles (Sat, 13:03)*\n\nMade it to the water stop with a decent pace, but the sun was high and we were completely exposed.  I was sapped and resigned myself to just walk until the AS.  I also realized my hands had started to swell so I concentrated on getting my electrolyte balance under control.  I had been taking salt chews as my water intake increased, but obviously not enough.  This was a rough section with very little shade and no places to sit if I wanted to rest.  None except on the ground and I didn’t trust my legs to get me back up if I did.\n\n*Bassett (manned), 134.8 miles (Sat, 16:48)*\n\nFinally rolled into Bassett hours after I had planned to see my wife.  I felt so much better seeing here there.  Took quite awhile here to try and cool down inside (a bit over an hour).  I changed clothes and shoes which was little difficult as my legs were really getting tight and sore.  Balance was not the best either.  I took a bit too long with my shoes off as I noticed how much they were swelling when I put the fresh pair on.  Luckily, I bought them half a size bigger.  It was tough to get out the door, but night was coming and the next few AS were close and manned.\nPace picked up for this section which was good, but the fatigue was definitely setting in as the [sun started going down](https://imgur.com/3FaAHQX).  I had not planned to sleep if I could help and hoped to be fast enough to not need it.  Long Pine was a sleep station with beds, but I wanted to avoid that trap.  A slight reroute here on some hilly, sandy back roads to get into town with lightning flashing in the sky.  Radar showed the cell was pretty far so I wasn’t too worried.  \n\n*Long Pine (manned), 144.7 miles (Sat, 20:51)*\n\nSpent about 25 minutes here doing the usual reset and got some sausage and bacon.  No new problems had come up so sucked it up and kept on going.  I don’t know if I sat too long or what, but the sleepiness hit hard on the next section.  Luckily, there were no reroutes and it was just a wide open trail as I was starting to weave around.  I hit one of the scenic bridges here (I think), but it was too dark to see anything.  It seemed high and stretched for quite a distance. It was getting hard to run at this point as the soles of my feet were getting tender and my calves were on fire.  Not too sore, but super tight.  I just focused on getting to the AS so I could take a nap.\n\n*Ainsworth (manned), 152.5 miles (Sat, 23:52)*\n\nRolled into the AS, dropped my gear, and went to the van for a 45-minute nap.  It was wonderful!  But so hard to get back out the van.  I had stiffened up so much and cooled off enough that it felt chilly.  Motivation to get back on the trail was very low.  Went back to the AS to get restocked to go and had some broth and a Redbull.  Both helped tremendously.  After about an hour and 20 minutes, I was back on the trail.\n\nGoal on this section was just to keep moving, especially after the rest.  It took awhile to get my legs loosened up.  With the way everything felt, I wasn’t concerned about the run/walk and just went by feel.  Ran when it felt good and then walked when it didn’t.\n\n*Johnstown (water), 164.3 (Sun, 5:04)*\n\nI took a couple of extra minutes at the water stop to sit on a convenient bucket, enjoying getting the pressure off my feet.  As the sun come up for the third time during this race (hard to believe saying that), I managed to get a third wind.  I realized my feet didn’t hurt that bad and my calves seemed fine.  I started back to a run/walk.  That felt great!  I shortened the walk breaks and things still felt good.  I passed several people in this section.  I ended up running some of the fastest miles of the race and almost got to the AS before my wife.\n\n*Wood Lake (manned), 174.9 miles (Sun, 7:49)*\n\nAs I restocked for the final push, I really hoped the good feelings would last.  Nothing really look appetizing at the AS so I took some candy for the road after about 20 minutes in the AS.  Otherwise, nutrition had been going good with the apple sauce and baby food pouches and my energy levels had been great.\nUnfortunately, my third wind only lasted for a few more miles, but I was happy with what I got being 180 miles into a race.  I walked the last few miles to the last water stop as the morning temps started to rise.  I wasn’t looking forward to the 90 degree temps forecasted for the afternoon.  I had really hoped to be done with this part.\n\n*Arabia (water), 184.6 miles (Sun, 10:50)*\n\nShort stop to refill water and stopped to chat a bit with a 100-miler who caught up to me.  He only wanted to make the cutoff (which he could do with walking), so we set off to trudge the last exposed miles.  This was tough.  We finally had some hills to deal with and there was nothing but pastures surrounding us.  I was so done, and like the previous day, there was very little shade and no place to sit.  We chatted some, trudged in silence some, and slowly made our way towards the finish.  After a few hours, he went on ahead at a faster walk to make sure he made the cutoff.  I had no worry about that so I continued with my trudge.\n\nEventually, I started getting closer to [civilization](https://imgur.com/OWGcZOw) but town seemed so far away.  I knew the [impressive bridge](https://imgur.com/oc3Ob9t) was coming up, but I never seemed to make any progress toward it.  It was a welcome sight when I finally [got there](https://imgur.com/o144QqP) and it did have an [impressive view](https://imgur.com/uzsHlpv).  The best part though was the bench on the other side with a shade.  I rested here with a deep sigh as I gathered my motivation to finish.\nMy only thoughts now were to move from one shade patch to the next as I crept into town.  On the map, the finish line looked so close from the edge of town, but in reality, I felt like I had to walk for miles.\n\n*Finish, 200.2 miles (Sun, 16:13)*\n\nFinally, I rounded the last corner and could see the finish arch….a block away.  I never though a block could feel so far.  I crossed [the finish line](https://imgur.com/U9NODH7) in 58 hours, 13 minutes, and 30 seconds [absolutely spent](https://imgur.com/iZJjawL). I was 8th place out of 45 finishers (76 runners started the race).\n\nhttps://www.strava.com/activities/12420268936\n\n____\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI was so happy to get into the finish line building and get off my feet and out of my pack.  I got my medal, [finish pic](https://imgur.com/BAf11qq), and sat down to get drink and snack.  It was then I realized the RD gave me the 100-mile buckle.  I got up to tease him that he was trying to short change me on my race.  He laughed and said he hadn’t gotten much sleep either.  With the [right buckle](https://imgur.com/4mChtuI) in hand, it was time to head to the hotel to assess damage, get a shower, and soak in the hot tub.\n\n\n____\n**What’s Next?**\n\nAlthough I had hoped for closer to a 48-hour finish, I was happy with the results.  I had really wanted to spend more time running later in the race, but the afternoon temps were pretty brutal.  During the tough parts with aching feet and legs, I questioned whether my training had been enough, but I think it was.  I was super stiff the rest of that day and the next morning, but besides tender feet, I had hardly any muscle soreness.  The main issue was swollen feet (which is to be expected) and tenderness on the soles of my feet.\n\nI plan to carry what I’ve learned into the next race which is a 48-hour race in April where I hope to get closer to 200 miles.  It’s a short loop race (1.8 mi) so logistics will be much easier.  If that goes well, I have my eyes on a 72-hour race in June where I can test out a longer format race on a loop course."

        "Texto": "Thought I’d post a little story about my first marathon experience just to help anyone who is interested in running one!\n\nFor background, I (M, 29) hadn’t run more than a mile or 2 as of last summer (2023). I ran my first 5K by myself while on vacation in July of 2023 in about 28 mins and was ecstatic. In the winter I ran my first half marathon on a treadmill (shoutout Omaha, NE weather) in just under 2 hours. I then had my sights set on a full marathon when the spring rolled around.\n\nI started actual training in May-June and followed a few different plans as I modified them to fit my schedule (having 2 kids under 2 is tough). I had my most accomplished training month in June when I clocked over 100 miles. Then in July I ran my 20 miler (very easy 11.27 pace) and had my best half marathon time of 1:54. I then finally cracked a sub 50 min 10K in August. I was feeling great!\n\nMy race was September 22, but at the end of August I started dealing with plantar fasciitis for the first time in my life. Went on my shortest run in the last year (less than 3 miles) on a weekend in late August and took one step with a sharp shooting pain running up my right leg. Had to limp to the nearest neighborhood and call my wife to pick me up. Then, a week later, had a wisdom tooth infection and had a poison ivy rash on both legs that also spread for the next 2 weeks (yeah, this was hell).\n\nI bought new shoes, rolled my foot and iced it for multiple nights before trying to run again. I did another 10K about a week before the race and felt fine, then when I got home felt the plantar fasciitis flare up just while walking around the house (devastating to say the least). As a last ditch effort I bought insoles off amazon that arrived days before the marathon. My last run was a 2 miler with these insoles 2 days before the marathon just to test them out.\n\nThe night before the marathon I can’t remember many times I was as nervous as I was besides my wedding day and the birth of my kids and MAYBE performing in front of an audience for the first time (I’m a musician). I woke up at 2AM and just couldn’t fall back asleep for the life of me. I got up around 4:30AM and rolled my foot out one last time, put on my gear and bib and headed out.\n\nMarathon day the energy was incredible. I’ve never run a race in my life (no 5Ks, 10Ks or HM’s) so I had no idea what to expect. The energy was crazy and it felt so cool to be apart of a group of people that put in the amount of dedication/effort that I had for the last months/year in isolation/solitude. What a feeling to have some crazy motherfuckers around you that did the same.\n\nI ate a banana and chugged a Gatorade and a couple waters before we officially started and I was off. My goal was sub 4 hours and I wanted to stay patient through the first half just to get a feel for the course. I didn’t want to have any splits come in under 9:05 and I didn’t which was tough because I am competitive and felt like I was really holding back. \n\nAs soon as I crossed the half marathon line I was feeling amazing and decided to pick up my pace a bit. The wind picked up around this time and the course began to get more hilly. I ran around 8:45 averages until mile 21 and still was feeling incredible! Then early into mile 22 I felt a pop in my hamstring and cramped up so bad I couldn’t move. Never dealt with cramps during any of my previous runs ever - so this was completely new territory for me.\n\nI grabbed my leg and massaged it for a bit and tried to run but was completely overcome with pain. I walked it out for a minute or so and then alternated between running as much as I could then walking when it became unbearable. There were so many moments between miles 22 and 26 that I felt like I couldn’t make it - it was so odd because the first 21 miles felt so good. \n\nThe last 5 miles I average about 13 minutes per mile which was difficult for me to swallow. I hit mile 25.5 and closed my eyes and sprinted as hard as I could to the finish line. I finished at 4:18 - but was so happy and proud to finish. Truly was a life-changing experience and I hope everyone can do it at least once.\n\nLessons: \n- The last 10K is as bad as everyone says lol\n- It’s okay to have a time goal for your first marathon, but you will feel so accomplished just crossing the finish line\n- It is one of, if not the, hardest things you will do in your life and I’m so glad I can reflect back on the marathon for a sense of perseverance, grit, determination and more that I always knew I had, but I have tangible proof of now\n- ANYONE can decide to run a marathon, put in the work and DO IT!",

        "Texto": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Sydney Marathon\n* **Date:** 15 September 2024\n* **Distance:** 42.2km\n* **Location:** Sydney, Australia\n* **Website:** https://sydneymarathon.com/\n* **Time:** 4:14:07\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | PB | *yes* |\n| B | Sub 4 | *no* |\n| C | Enjoy it | *yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Km | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 5 | 27:59\n| 10 | 28:32\n| 15 | 28:23\n| 20 | 29:23\n| 21 | 06:15\n| 25 | 23:07\n| 30 | 31:31\n| 35 | 32:58\n| 40 | 32:41\n| 42.195 | 13:19\n\n### Background\nI’m a 39-year-old male, and this was my first marathon. I ran the Sydney Half Marathon back in May 2018 with a time of 1:56:14 and hiked the Oxfam 100km the following year. However, since COVID in 2020, my fitness levels declined, and I needed motivation to get back into a routine before turning 40 next year.\n\nIn May 2024, I signed up for the Sydney Marathon, giving myself 20 weeks to train.\n\n### Training\nI started by getting a running technique assessment and shoe fitting at Running Science in Rozelle, Sydney. Since I’ve had knee problems in the past, I thought this would be a great starting point. The session gave me advice to improve my technique and reduce strain on my knees, including:\n1. Decrease stride length\n2. Increase cadence\n3. Transition from heel to mid-foot ground contact\n4. Kick up legs after ground contact (like running in long grass)\n\nFor both training and race day, I bought Brooks Glycerin GTS 21 shoes.\n\nMy training plan was as follows:\n* Aerobic: One long run per week, starting at 8km and increasing by 10% per week while working on my technique.\n* Anaerobic: One soccer game per week (around 5km running).\n* Stretching: 1–2 times a day with a solid warm-up/cool-down for runs.\n* Strength: 1–3 sessions per week focusing on knee stability and muscle building.\n* Endurance: Hiking/walking, starting at 20km per week and increasing by 10%.\n* Nutrition: Eating whole foods with minimal processed carbs.\n* Lifestyle: Walking when possible, taking stairs over elevators, standing at work, minimal alcohol, lots of water, 7+ hours of sleep.\n* Supplements: Krill oil + glucosamine for joint health, androgaphis + vitamin C + zinc for immunity, and 30g of protein powder for muscle repair.\n\nUnfortunately, I fractured my rib a month into training, slowing me down, but I managed to keep running through the pain. It took 5 weeks to fully heal.\n\nHalfway through, I had a 6-week holiday. I maintained long runs but let my nutrition and strength training slip a little. Toward the end of the trip, I caught COVID and stopped all training for 2 weeks, but thankfully, my lung capacity and breathing was unaffected when I returned to running.\n\nIn the final month of training, I was up to 42km hikes and 21km weekly runs, and I felt great... until I sprained my left ankle and overloaded my right knee three weeks before race day. I rested, did physio, and managed a few short runs. In the 2 weeks leading up to the marathon, I ran maybe 25km in total. Despite the setbacks and cutting training short, I was determined to be at the starting line.\n\n### Pre-race\nSydney had experienced its hottest winter day on record (31°C) just weeks before. But race day was forecast to be a cool 15°C—what a relief!\n\nIn the three days before the race, I focused on sleep, hydration, and nutrition, eating lots of whole foods (chicken, veggies, fruit, nuts, salmon) and high-GI carbs (bagels, white pasta, rice, potatoes). \n\nMy ankle and knee had fully healed and I stayed positive, kept healthy, and thankfully remained illness-free.\n\nThe night before, I stayed with friends in North Sydney. Despite only getting one hour of deep sleep due to excitement and nerves, I rested well and was glad after 20 weeks of training, race day was finally here!\n\n### Race\nI woke up at 4am and had a bagel with jam, a banana, and some Greek yogurt with blueberries for breakfast.\n\nI arrived at North Sydney Oval at 5:40am, one hour before my wave (E1) start at 6:40. After a quick warm-up and waiting in the cold, windy 8°C weather, I was ready.\n\nBy 6:30, we were in the pens, walking to the start line. There wasn’t a grand send-off for my wave, we just walked up to the start line and set off running!\n\nThe start was downhill to the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge. Every lane was closed for us, the sun was rising into clear blue skies, and I was running my first-ever marathon—what a feeling!\n\nThe first 15km felt great, running through Pyrmont, Barangaroo, and The Rocks while soaking in the atmosphere and views.\n\nAt the 16km mark, I saw my family excitedly cheering me on, I practically flew up the Oxford St hill. \n\nI took my first gel at 18km and crossed the halfway mark (21.1km) under 2 hours, on track for a sub-4-hour finish.\n\nAt 24km, fatigue hit my quads hard. I took another gel and some Hydralyte, but realised my muscles wouldn’t improve. I had no choice but to drop my pace and shift my focus from the sub-4-hour to finishing.\n\nThe Anzac Parade stretch and Centennial Park loop were mentally tough, I was far from the energetic city crowds and iconic city views. I took comfort knowing my fellow runners were feeling the same and it felt like a team effort to collectively complete this section of the course. I remembered my reasons for running today and envisioned myself crossing the finish line, many times. \n\nI took gels at 30km and 35km, my thirst increased as the gels dried me out. I had carried 500ml of Hydralyte, which was long gone. I was very grateful to see the kind volunteers at the water stations!\n\nFinally, heading back into the city, I saw my family again at 37km, their cheers this time kept me going. I was tired but locked in to finish the final 5km, just one park run to go.\n\nRunning out to Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair, I reminded myself to relax, savour it, to be present in the moment and just enjoy that final downhill stretch to the finish line at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nI completed my first marathon in a time of 4 hours and 14 minutes.\n\n### Post-race\nThe moment I stopped running, my legs almost gave out, but I kept moving to avoid collapsing in front of the Opera House crowd. After grabbing my medal and walking the 500m cooling down route, I reflected on what felt like one of the greatest achievements of my life.\n\nI met up with family and friends, stretched, ate a cereal bar, and took a few photos, feeling on top of the world.\n\nWe grabbed lunch at Circular Quay, where we exchanged stories of the race and the experience in the crowd.\n\nOnce home, I cooled down in the pool, followed by a hot bath and some time with the foam roller. My muscles were sore, but I was thrilled to be completely pain-free.\n\nI know I can improve on my training and race fueling, and I enjoyed the experience enough to want to go for that sub-4-hour goal next time!\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Gulf Beach Half Marathon\n* **Date:** September 14, 2024\n* **Distance:** 13.1 miles\n* **Location:** Milford, CT\n* **Website:** http://www.shorelinesharks.com/Events/GulfBeachHalf.htm\n* **Time:** 1:42:38\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Get there | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 1:45 | *Yes* |\n| C | All Miles <8:00 | *No* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 8:00\n| 2 | 7:45\n| 3 | 7:39\n| 4 | 7:37\n| 5 | 7:42\n| 6 | 7:36\n| 7 | 7:45\n| 8 | 7:44\n| 9 | 7:51\n| 10 | 8:00\n| 11 | 8:05\n| 12 | 8:00\n| 13 | 8:05\n\n### Training\n38/F. I was supposed to run this race a year ago but got diagnosed with a wicked tibial stress fracture and was on crutches 100% non-weight bearing for 3 months. I ended up volunteering instead, which was fun but definitely wanted to run it this year! I did a return to run program last February, then progressively built my mileage to 25mpw on 4 days/week (all while in PT). I ran the HamdenFest Half at the beginning of June with no expectations but ended up <1min off my PB. \n\nI had this race as my end of summer goal and knew that I wanted to go for a PR. Before I got hurt I never ran more than 30mpw and didn’t do any goal pace specific workouts. I did not follow a specific plan this go around. I set up a 12 week training block with 5 days/week running and 4 days/week strength (reduced from 5 days/week when I was only running 4). I built up to 40mpw which I maintained for 5 weeks and incorporated alternating weeks goal pace specific short interval and tempo workouts. I also did some longer interval workouts inside my long runs, but those were brutal (and largely not on target) thanks to the oppressive heat/humidity this summer. I definitely got really comfortable being uncomfortable!\n\n### Pre-race\nI’m used to getting up at 4 to run before work, so that part was a non-issue. Ate, had coffee, did my mobility routine, and got out the door by 5:20. 30m drive to the race venue got me there minutes before a massive line of cars showed up looking for parking. I was fortunate to get a spot in the lot directly across the street from registration. \n\nBib pick up was quick and easy, hit the bathroom, and then back to the truck to get ready. It was about 6 by then so shoes on, ibuprofen down, and did my dynamic warmup. Then I had half a bag of skratchers gummies (completely forgot to take my salt stick tabs and never remembered until farrr too late) and went for another bathroom break (one thing about me is I will always use the bathroom “just in case” and if there is any spare time, I will use it again). I went for a quick jog up and down the main road from the port a potties back to my truck. Then I got my number pinned to my shorts, lost the tank top, loaded up my gels (in the front of my bra, very high tech), and grabbed my handheld water bottle.\n\nI was back and forth on the water bottle until the last minute - would it slow me down more to carry it or to not have it when I wanted it? The air was feeling warm enough at 6:45 that chose the latter (I also ran all of my long runs and many of my intervals with it this summer, so I am very used to carrying it and managing it while taking gels). Locked up my key and then back to the bathroom one more time (lol). Then I inserted myself in the front third of the start group and we were off relatively quickly. \n\n### Race\nI just recently started having better workouts (thank you cooler weather) so even though I built quite a bit of fitness (and grit) during the summer, I was not confident in my ability to hold a sub 8:00 pace for 13 miles (having never done it before, I held it for 10k in the middle of a 12 mile long run workout a few weeks ago). Anyway, I convinced myself to just be brave and go for it. \n\nThe “plan” was to run sub 8:00 minute miles for the first half and then ease back if I felt like I was going to die. I didn’t look at my watch until about 3 miles in (I was about .15 out of sync with the mileage signs on the way out but dead on, on the way back) and saw I was in the 7:30-7:45 range which felt like work but doable so I just tried to settle into that. I was supposed to take a gel at 4 but I missed mile 4 completely somehow, so I had it at 5 instead (Maurten caffeine).\n\nI had my own water on me (tg) so I just tried to stay out of the way at the aid stations. I expected this to be pretty flat and it was - no elevation to talk about. The worst part for me was running on the wood boardwalk which felt really slippery with sand. Aside from one car that tried to drive throught the middle of the race (saw that \"gentleman\" stopped with the cop who was at the next intersection), the small bit of traffic was respectful and the police did a good job keeping the crossings safe.\n\nI made it to the turn around and still felt pretty good, so I decided to just keep going until pushing felt like diminishing returns (I did not want to crash and burn like I did at Hamden Hills 2023 - I was already planning on a positive split but not a dramatic one). Was supposed to have another gel at 8 but my stomach didn’t want it and I didn’t talk myself into it until like 9.5 (Maurten). We had a nice breeze coming off the water and a decent amount of shade, but it was warm and the sun felt hot - I was definitely feeling the pace coming into 10. \n\nI hate miles 10 and 11, they feel like no man’s land to me. I kept trying to relax into the effort and while I did lose the sub 8:00s, it wasn’t by much and it was worth not feeling like I might blow up. \n\nI felt better mentally during 12 and 13 but I was honestly just tired at that point so I did not try to speed up until I could see the finish arch. The last .1 was sub 8:00 (lol again). I lapped my watch at the physical halfway point and it measured 6.67 miles on the way out (average 7:43/mile) and 6:50 miles on the way back (average 7:56/mile). So yes, positive split but I felt good about it.\n\n### Post-race\nI felt a bit shaky from the adrenaline and effort when I stopped, but definitely not destroyed. I made sure to keep walking because my legs felt tight. Got some ice water to sip on and made my way back to the truck. I got my race results via text on my watch on the walk back. I was pretty drenched and pouring saltwater into my eyes (I think I would have felt better if I’d remembered the salt sticks but too late) so I took a little bit to just chill out. \n\nI ended up running a 3:58 min PR of 1:42:38 and even though I did not meet my sub-8:00 on every mile goal, I did meet my sub 8:00 average goal with 7:50/mile average. Less important - finished 3/55 Female 35-39, 22/390 Female, and 97/704 Overall. \n\nNext up - taking a few days off running then will be running a bunch of easy miles this fall to work towards running 5 days consecutively. Planning to maintain on 30-35mpw for a bit and run some local 5k/10k races as occasional speed workouts. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "# Race Information\n\n* **Name:** DC Half\n* **Date:** September 15, 2024\n* **Distance:** 13.1 miles\n* **Location:** Washington, DC\n* **Website:** [https://www.dchalfmarathon.com](https://www.dchalfmarathon.com)\n* **Time:** 1:22\n\n# Goals\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A|PR (1:43)|*Yes*|\n|B|1:30|*Yes*|\n|C|1:25|*Yes?!*|\n\n# Splits\n\n|Mile|Time|\n|:-|:-|\n|1-6|6:07ish|\n|7-13|6:17ish|\n\n# Training\n\nI'm training for the Richmond Marathon in November using [Hal Higdon's Intermediate 2](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-2-marathon/) plan. The plan calls for a half marathon halfway through (week 9 of 18). It will be my fifth marathon, but the first for which I've been disciplined in my training. I decided I want to run Boston. With some research, I figured out that I needed to lose weight to do so, so I've lost 25 pounds (11kg) since May. Currently 150 lbs (68 kg) and 5'8\" (173 cm), 31 year-old male.\n\nTraining is going well after a serious hiccup. Five weeks ago I tripped on an uneven sidewalk and landed hard on my knee. Strained my hamstring, which reduced milage and pace for two weeks. Almost fully recovered now.\n\nCross training is cycling or swimming, once a week. While I was injured, I replaced several runs with swimming. I slightly increased the milage of the first few weeks of the plan by adding one or two miles to the shortest runs. \"Race-pace runs\" were new to me, but apparently helpful, as they keep getting faster, from 6:50 to 6:30/mile.\n\nFinally, I decided to see what all the hype around supershoes was about, on the recommendation of a couple of friends. I bought a pair of Nike Vaporfly 3s, and went on one four-mile run in them before the race. They were an absolute game-changer for me. Any given pace simply took less effort relative to other shoes.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nWoke up at 0445, had a simple cereal breakfast (450 cal). I arrived at 0600 for the 0700 start. Pacers Running set up a really well-organized event. Changed into the Vaporflys and left my stuff at the Bag Check. I decided to eat before and not during the race: two gels and a canned latte (300 cal, 200 mg caffeine). Self-seeded at the start, just a bit in front of the 1:30 pace group. Absolutely perfect weather: 64°F (18°C) and mostly cloudy.\n\n# Race\n\nRight out of the start, I had two short-lived issues. First, my almost-healed knee hurt. Totally unexpected. It has felt a little sore on recent long runs, but only after many miles. Pain was gone after half a mile and did not come back, but I'll have to keep an eye on it. Second, I self-seeded too far back. I spent two miles trying to pass people on the crowded loop around East Potomac Park. I would slow down a little later, so perhaps it was best that my speed was limited at the start.\n\nI grabbed a cup of water at Mile 4. From Miles 4 to 6, there are great views of the Tidal Basin, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial, and a lot of cheering spectators. I got a boost from seeing a friend of mine who was volunteering at a water stop. At this point I realized I was feeling really good; nutrition and hydration were just right. I wasn't tired and my legs felt fine. I figured the only way I wasn't going to hit my goals is if I tripped again. Most of the rest of the course is an out-and back on the scenic Rock Creek Parkway, with trees and enormous bridges overhead. The turnaround is at Mile 8, and this is where I very nearly tripped again. I tried to take the U-turn very tightly, and the Vaporflys were unstable in that banked turning position. I felt like I was about to roll my ankle and fall on my face, but somehow I recovered.\n\nAnother cup of water at Mile 10. I tried to pick up the pace here a little, but I found I couldn't. Perhaps I should have saved one of the gels for this point. Around the Tidal Basin, and past the Jefferson Memorial to the finish.\n\n# Post-race\n\nFinisher swag included a nifty beach towel! Took a couple of photos and walked to the Metro. It's only been a few hours, but I feel pretty great. That's the other thing I've heard about supershoes - recovery is way faster. I'm pleased with the result, and I have more confidence that I can reach my marathon goals. Goal A is a comfortable Boston (and Chicago) time at 2:52. Goal B is a stretch: 2:45 for Berlin. At some point I'll probably try to be just a little faster at a New York Road Runners half marathon, because breaking 1:21 at one of their events would qualify me for the New York Marathon.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

Not long after that race I came to the conclusion I had gone as far on my own as I reasonably could and it was time to get a coach. I'm sure I could have continued to bumble my way through and become a quicker runner but my rate of progress over the last year has been much faster thanks to having a more structured training plan and *intentional* workouts. The first six months from last marathon was all about building up speed, I didn't realise at the time but my coach put me through a couple of 5k training blocks and brought my pb down from a 19:01 to 17:24. I then did a half marathon training block and that took my HM from 1:26:52 to 1:19:50. During the marathon training block I also had a HM race where I was then able to take another minute off that time. \n\nMy weekly schedule widely varies due to my work but an average training week looks something like Mon - 1hr easy, Tue - hard workout, Wed - 1hr easy, Thu - rest day, Fri - threshold, Sat - 40min easy, Sun - long run. During the marathon training block the workouts both got slower and threshold became longer, the easy days / long run also got longer and some were with efforts. My final long run before two week taper was 1hr easy into 15k@4:00, 1k easy into 5k@3:50. \n\nIt was after this long run that everything fell apart. The following day I went gokarting with a friend, spun out and injured my side the crash. At first I thought I'd just bruised myself but after a few days it was still extremely painful to breathe, which was a concern. \n\nOn top of this, a week earlier I'd caught a cold which I thought was mostly dealt with on that final long run, as I was able to get through the run, it was tough but I got nailed the paces. However it came back twice as hard afterwards, my very easy tuesday workout compared to previous weeks I could barely hold on to pace, constantly coughing my lungs up. Then on the friday threshold I completely blew up, I couldn't manage to run a single km at mara pace, this was a massive knock to my confidence less than two weeks out from race day. It was time to see a doctor. After an examination it was confirmed I had a chest infection, immediately I began to take the doctor prescribed antibiotics. And then the scans came back, fortunately I hadn't broken the rib but I had a fracture / internal bruising, nothing to be done but give it time to let it heal. \n\nOver the next week and a bit, I slowly but surely improved, the antibiotics cleared the worst of the infection and my breathing got easier each day. On race day eve I was still coughing but no where near as often and my rib only hurt when I took very deep breaths. My confidence still wasn't there but after a call from my coach, he was able to pump me up somewhat with his advice for the race and by reminding me that the work I'd done didn't disappear. \n\nTl;dr - A very strong mara block build up to the worst taper imaginable. \n\n### Pre-race\n\nHistory might not repeat but sometimes it rhymes. Last year I titled my race report racing the heat and clearly the organisers were also concerned about this as they completely removed the HM race from the event to allow the marathon to start earlier at 6am. I mostly liked the earlier start time but fortunately it wasn't needed this year as the heatwave hit two weeks earlier and by race day weather was forecast for a very comfortable high of 18ºC (64ºF). No, the weather had something else for us instead: 'damaging winds' as my weather app very politely told me, which would increase throughout the morning. Well, can't control the weather but at least they fixed the trains right? \n\nWell... not exactly. The organisers tried to schedule more services but there was union action meaning less trains and stopping at every station to slow things down. Not that this mattered as my line was, same as last year, cancelled for trackwork and the replacement buses weren't going to get me to the start line in time. Luckily the new metro line which had just opened provided a decent solution, I was able to drive most of the way into the city to reach Sydenham Station, and then catch the metro to the Victoria Cross station, just a few minutes from the start line, however it did mean having to wake up at 3:15am. Getting off the metro and *boy* it was cold, all that heat training I did a few weeks ago seemed quite silly and maybe even counter-productive. Luckily there wasn't any wind. Yet. \n\nWalking up to the starting area and ducking into some nearby secret toilets that I won't disclose to avoid the queues, I was able to spot a few friends and caught up with them. Then the announcement, the gates for group A, my group, were about to open and that we would need to be in before they closed them off behind us at ~5:30am, half an hour before gun time. I did some very quick strides and stretches and utilised the standing urinal to free myself from the nervous pee (what a godsend), then hustled for the gate. \n\nIt opened and everyone marched forward and straight into confusion. This was the only part of the day which I felt hadn't been adequately explained. (the 72 page event guide sent out was extensive) There was another fence in front of us, blocking us from being able reach the actual road, we were all still on the grass and so everyone just bundled up like sardines, most people seemed unsure about what was going on but we all assumed that *any moment now* they'd open the gates. \n\nFortunately sardines was a good way to be at this point because the wind had started up and it was already bitterly cold. Because the fence had mesh on it, you couldn't see what was going on on the other side and while the road had speakers, it seemed like they hadn't considered the waiting area so we couldn't quite hear what the announcer was saying. All I could see was the top of the pacers flags poking over, wait does that mean people were lined up with them? It took some time to realise they were just doing their warm up strides.\n\n~**Bang**~ - 5:50am, a couple of people looked panicked and there was some murmurs but most people realised it was just the wheelchair race starting off. \n\n~**Bang**~ 6:00am, a lot more people looked panicked this time, \"wait, was that the starting gun?\" someone asked. These people were quelled as others confidently told them it was just the elites starting, wave A would begin at 6:05am. \n\nA minute later the gates were moved and a trickle of people started to move through, it was agonisingly slow. 6:03am and I finally got through and was on the road, however I had no time to appreciate the setup of the start line as I darted my way forward, searching for the 2:50 pacer that I knew I needed to find and stick with, I wasn't about to make the same mistake from last year, starting further back and spending the entire race playing catch up. Just as I reached the pacer-\n\n~**Bang**~ 6:05am and the race was on. \n\n### Race\n\nWe took off down the hill, the course started not next to Luna Park this year but in North Sydney. This downhill start definitely felt much more thrilling as people battled against the instinctual urge within them to pick up the pace and hurtle down the road towards the bridge. \n\nThe bridge. Iconic as always, unfortunately we were robbed of the picturesque postcard sunrise photos due to some clouds on the horizon but none the less stunning and with blue skies above it looked like we were in for some stellar weather. I settled in around the 2:50 pacer and a large group that was following him. Just as I started to get comfortable with my position in the pack, we ran into our first roadblocks. \n\nIt wasn't just the elites who had started at 6:00am. I had completely forgotten that it was also the age group world championship and they had also all started on the same gun. While for their age these folk are absolutely crushing it, an 89yo running an incredible 5:30:00 marathon may as well be standing still to a pack of a hundred people running at 4:00min/k. Suddenly we were weaving all over the place, side-stepping and trying not to trip each other over as we avoided colliding into the age groupers. Someone near me said 'this is just ridiculous' and I have to agree, they should have ensured that the age groupers knew, at least for the first few km of the course to stick to one side of the road to allow safe overtaking. We continued our overtake for the rest of the race but it became mostly a non-issue after the first 10k once people had spread out and the people we were overtaking were also running a bit quicker.\n\nAfter the bridge, aside from weaving through age groupers things became very peaceful. I actually enjoyed it mostly, soaking in the relative silence of early morning Sydney, only broken by the sound of shoes hitting tarmac. However it did feel like the course was lacking a bit of energy. Turns out I was right as I found out after the run that several spots where DJ/performers were supposed to be playing hadn't had their generators delivered and so had no power. Mostly a non-issue for us runners but I know it would have been a let down for those performers as well as the supporters who had gone to those sites expecting more of a party vibe. I'm sure this was a mistake the organisers will learn from. \n\nAt this point I had settled into the pace nicely and was just comfortably following the red shirt of the pacer ahead of me. My watch was saying we were running ahead of pace but he assured me that we were right on it, given the skyscrapers around us I decided to trust him and didn't back off the pace. Risky decision perhaps given the horror stories I've heard but it paid off as he was right. The hills around the 17k mark made the pace feel a bit more difficult than I would have liked but I just stuck to the pacer like glue. \n\nOut past Centennial park and then turn back and a circle around it, this new version of the course felt mentally a *lot* better to me than last year. Maybe the lack of heat was playing a part but not being trapped in the park for so long made the k's go by faster. However the wind became everyone's biggest enemy. Once out of Sydney CBD, the protection of the buildings was gone and the wind picked up. Our pace group which had thinned considerably by 21km began to form lopsided V formations to try and best avoid being buffeted by winds as they changed direction, taking turns moving to the front with the pacer doing the lords work at the point. At one stage I ran out from the protection of the formation to throw out a gel wrapper in a nearby bin and very nearly got knocked over as the wind caught me. \n\nAt 35k we turned a corner and suddenly the wind was on our backs and we had a downhill in front of us. Several people took the opportunity to open up their stride and pull ahead of the pacer. I considered doing this, I knew we were near the end. But I decided in that moment that I had everything to lose and little to gain by making a move. Sure, I could have picked up some extra seconds off my time, but I also could have been caught out in the wind alone or go too hard and blow up. I told myself that no one was really going to care if I was a 2:49 marathoner or a 2:47 marathoner, but finishing at 2:51 would be a different story. So I just stayed with the pacer, at this point there was only maybe three of us with him and he kept the energy high, hyping up the crowd as we went past. \n\nAround and down towards mrs macquaries chair, the crowd cheering next to the Domain was insane, I've never heard it that loud before on a race. Then we hit the small steep downhill and for the first time my legs buckled just ever so slightly, a reminder that my muscles were screaming, maxed out by the distance and any wrong step could cause them to fold, would I be okay for the final downhill to the finish line?\n\nAround the chair and back up the hill, I slowed intentionally, ever so slightly, letting the pacer move ahead knowing that if I tried to keep the pace flat, the effort would increase on this insidious, deceiving hill. But my spirits were high, I knew I only had 2k to go now and I was feeling much stronger than I had a year ago at this point in the run. \n\nBack onto the flat and I picked up the pace now, catching up to the pacer one final time. Thank you David, I stuck to you like glue for 41k and now you were waving me on to greatness. \"Send it Cam!\" he yelled as I finally allowed myself let go of the discipline of my 4:00min/k pace and lean into the final downhill. Now I was flying and the final flat before the opera house finish was coming up. Eyes up this time, I didn't soak in the crowd last year but I wouldn't let that happen this year. Would I slow down once I lost the assistance of gravity? \n\nNo, rounded the bend and saw on the finish line clock it was at 2:54:30 and counting up. Somewhere in my subconscious a voice said if we'd started 5min behind gun time I had to race that clock down to the second to finish under 2:50. 100m sprint, 2:55min/k pace after running 42km and with the roar of the crowd it felt easy. \"I did it!\" I shouted in relief as I crossed the finish line. How generic, gotta work on that one I think. \n\n### Post-race\n\nI think the clock was 2:55:02 when I crossed but I stopped my watch and looked at my time and saw I was comfortably below 2:49, thank goodness! No time to stop though, we were all ushered to continue walking. Collected my medal and a bag they handed out with some food/water. The plan I'd made with my wife was to meet her at the 'reunite zone'. Something the organisers had planned where there would be flags with different letters on them and you'd be able to sit under the flag and wait for the person who was looking for you to come and find you. A great idea, only I couldn't for the life of me find this reunite zone, nor could my wife. And none of the staff seemed to know anything about it. Luckily I'd put an airtag in my zip pocket and she was able to find me that way and informed me of my time 2:48:53. No idea if we just missed the reunite zone entirely or if they somehow forgot to set it up. \n\nAfter enjoying a toilet stop, short lie down, the fun of leg cramps, another toilet stop and some water, I was up and walking. Queued briefly for the photo spot that had your finisher time but the queue was ridiculously long and not moving anywhere near fast enough so gave up on that. Changed into some comfier clothes and hit up the same italian joint as last year, even though it was barely 11am by the time we got there for lunch. \n\nAll in all, there was really only a couple of very minor issues from what I saw this year. Otherwise the event was incredibly well organised. The volunteers were amazing and there were so many of them along the entire course, so cool! I think they could have used a bit more of a briefing so every knew what was going on but that will also come with time as all the moving parts of such a big event become more routine. In my mind there is no doubt that Sydney *will* be a major next year. And with the elites like Brimin Kipkorir Misoi breaking our all-comers Australian marathon record this year, this hard, hilly course has proved it has a hidden potential."

I had started to build a base back in January, slowly building my way up to... an injury. Reset. \n\nAfter a couple weeks rest and test runs, I incorporated some hip strength training and tried the base buildup again, but slower. From 20 miles, to 23 miles, to 24 miles, and then having every 4th week be a little bit of a recovery week, I built my mileage up to 40-45 for a few weeks before plateauing. I also made sure the most important run of each week, the long run, was of quality and quantity. I increased each long run about 2 miles per week, building up from 12, to 14, to 16, to 19, to 21, to 18, 16,and back down to 14 for the start of the taper. Those long runs are what I believe, the singular reason I was able to prolong the bonk as far as I did. \n\nI did not do many workouts, as I was more focused on staying healthy and maintaining mileage than I was about getting the race of a lifetime in, but I did sign up for some races here and there. Between a 1:18:34 half marathon and a top 30 finish for our team at Hood to Coast this year, I knew I had some leg speed to rely on for a little buffer in the marathon. Not that you ever need true leg speed in a marathon, but knowing a certain pace is comfortable surely does help! I even recorded my first 800 since high school, a 2:18, where my shoe flew off first step after the gun! I guess I can record that as a single shoe PR lol!\n\n### Pre-race\nI don't have a standard Pre-race ritual. I had the gels that I knew worked for me, I packed light, I got my bathroom stops in, and I was ready to go! I did about a mile warmup with a college buddy, as we had prepared to run this together a few months back, and we went over our race plan again. Qualify for Boston. 6:40's to start, do NOT deviate from that plan. At mile 16, we check in and if one of us is antcy, the other can approve to go from there. We wanted a slight buffer in case there was another 2023 event where we had to run over 7 minutes faster than the qualifier to get in. I knew I'd see my girlfriend, sister, cousin, as well as one of my good friends during the course, since there are out and backs, and some of them were doing the half marathon. My sister did the calculations, and assumed we would see each other around mile 18 for me, and mile 8 for them, and that would have to be the last motivation boost we get before suffering through the wall.\n\n### Race\nAs you can tell from the splits, our race plan was left at the start line... Between the adrenaline, the crowd, comfortability of the pace, and everything else, we held about 6:20-6:25's for the first 12 or so miles. We kept checking in with each other to make sure it was still maintainable and comfortable, and neither of us felt it was strenuous so we kept at it. We worked our way up to a group of 6-7 runners (Which for a 200 person race, was pleasantly surprising to have so many talented runners up this far) working together to push for a 2:50 marathon time. I was taking gels every 40 minutes, as I practiced every 6 miles during long runs. We make our turn to go up the hill to circle back around for lap two of the marathon course, and my friend unexpectedly stops and starts walking. The whole group looks back, since we all had such a good groove going, it shocked us all. Turns out some gatorade came back up and he had to take care of that business. He gave me the thumbs up, and I knew I had to make the decision there to either let him be for a little bit, or to continue with the group. I figured there were too many factors left to kill the momentum. How would my legs feel starting up? How is he feeling, will he be able to continue? Are there going to be more hiccups? Will one of us hit the wall sooner than the other? I kept rolling with the group and hoped he would be able to catch up to the stragglers when they fall off.\n\nMeanwhile, I had been chatting a little with the group, and they were talking about making an attempt to catch the guy in third place. The top 2 runners were so far ahead of us, that it would have been suicide to even think about trying to catch them. However, on the out and back sections, we noticed that the runner in third was within a reasonable effort to catch. Everything would have to go right for us, but my race mentality kicked in, and I threw everything I remembered about \"the wall\" out the window. For miles 14-15, I cruise through some low 6's with another runner, as we talked about our glory days in college and our first marathon experiences. At one point he tells me, \"We are either geniuses, or idiots. Let's hope we didn't just ruin our BQ by going for glory!\" We both laugh, but the thought definitely made me realize I may have made a mistake. Turns out I'm running next to a guy who did a 2:38 last year but just didn't ever sign up for Boston, and I'm just seeing myself as the 3:06'er I did last year. Every mile we go past, we keep looking up to see if we can even see the runner in third. No luck. At mile 16, I'm starting to get the ever so slightest feeling in my calves, and I start to worry about cramps. I've been great about water and gatorade and gels, but when you're running a marathon, sometimes your legs just don't care about that. I tell my new race partner he should go ahead, but he stays right next to me and reinforces he needs me here too, for him. We go through two more miles at low 6's, and sure enough right at the 18 mile marker, I see my sister! About a minute later, I see my girlfriend, and another minute later I see my friend come around the corner. The last stretch is here! \n\nMiles 19-26 were BRUTAL. I honestly do not know how I was able to maintain those paces my watch was telling me. During this time, I see my college buddy on the waterfront part of the out section, while I'm on my way back. I knew he would have to work for that BQ, and if he was feeling any worse than I was right now, that would be a tall order to ask. I took my first walking break at around mile 20, allowing myself to mentally reset and prepare for one 10k. It's just one 10k, I've done hundreds of 10k's, this one will only be slightly harder! I made it about half a mile with that mentality before taking another walk break. I then changed my mentality of \"6 miles left, 5.5 miles left\", to more of a \"half mile rep before next 10 second walk break\" type of attitude. I maintained that for another 4 miles or so. I quickly realized I needed to walk rather than shuffle. I wasn't aerobically fatigued, it was ALL my legs, and they just needed a tiny rest from the pounding that only walking could accomplish. I kept looking at my watch to see how much time I had to play with to hit certain times. \"If I hit 7:30's for the last four miles, that would be a 2:51, can I break 2:50? What pace for 2:50?\" I would pass some of the half marathoners only for them to pass me back when I started walking, just to pass them back on my next half mile rep. The walk breaks got more frequent during those last two miles, and it took everything I had to make it up the hill to turn the corner and see the finish line about a quarter mile down the road. I can see the 2:48:50 on the screen when I turn the corner, and for a split second, I think I could break 2:50. I start to pick up the pace and sprint... For about 2 steps. I get the absolute worst cramp I've ever had in my life in my right hamstring, and I can't move at all. I spent about 10 seconds bent over, trying to get my hamstring able to move, watching the clock glaze over that 2:50 mark. I gather all my energy and hobble across the finish line in 2:50:37, very safely under what I'm assuming the BQ will end up being.\n\n### Post-race\nImmediately after I have to walk off whatever monster was attacking my hamstring. My family was at the finish line, helping me massage it, handing me water, and even retreiving some mustard from the food line. It took me a few tries, since straight mustard isn't really the first thing I look forward to eating after a race, but I managed to get some down to help with the cramps. I wait for my friend to finish, unfortunately just missing the 3 hour mark... He seems to be in high spirits, since that was a 15 minute PR for him. As for me, that was also a 16 minute PR for me, and I now get to wait to see if my time was good enough to make Boston in April!\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

This was my first half marathon (and first running event > 10K) since 2012. I'd largely converted to cycling after two knee surgeries and 12 intervening years. My sister talked me into doing this event with her, which rekindled my love for running, so I'm glad to be here writing this up.\n\n### Training\nI had a strong cardio base from cycling, but I hadn't hardly run a mile in a couple of years when I started preparing for this race. The registration was in February, leaving 7 full months to prepare. I trained using Athletica.ai, which is a pretty cool paid tool that someone in the /r/RedditPZ community turned me onto. I think it really helped me have better workouts and have strong insight into my performance. I started out with short walk/run type stuff in February and peaked at about 35 miles per week, almost all easy. My easy pace started out in the 12s and was in the mid 10s by race day. \n\n### Pre-race\nGoing into the race, I tapered well and was feeling strong. I had run a 56 minute 10K in June, so I knew I was more-or-less on track for my A goal of sub-2. I felt like I had a few advantages coming into the race - namely, I'd lived and trained at minor altitude (2500-3000 feet) and was racing at sea level; and I had done a lot of training in very hot temperatures (90+F) - but, critically, never in humidity. There's none to be had at home, ever. \n\nThe forecast for the race start was 75F and 75% humidity, with the heat rapidly increasing after dawn. Sunrise was just after 7 AM with a 5 AM gun time, so 3/4 of the race was pre-dawn for me. It was very muggy. I'm sure folks from the US southeast are laughing at this, but this is Los Angeles, not Biloxi.\n\n### Race\nI was in E corral, so my start time was about 30 minutes after the gun. From the start, I had concerns. While I felt fine and was running well, the first 5 miles were mostly inside Disneyland and DCA, with many sharp turns and chokepoints, and many more people showing poor race etiquette by walking in wide groups blocking entire points of the course, not staying right, and so on. As for me, I stupidly elected to bob and weave all over the place, which improved my splits there but robbed me of too much energy. I exited that part of the course just after mile 5 about two minutes ahead of goal pace. \n\nAfter leaving the parks, the course was pretty dull for a while. It was basically just a meandering jaunt through suburban Anaheim. There were some spots with good numbers of spectators cheering and such, though I suspect there may have been more later on in the morning. Periodically there were DJs, and there was also a cool afrobeat (?) band and a marching band at points. My focus for this leg was to stay at or below threshold until I was far enough that I knew I could finish it out if I went anaerobic, and I did pretty well, holding on until around 1:20 or so. \n\nAbout mile 10 or so is when I was starting to feel some fatigue. As I mentioned, it was really warm and humid, and the humidity in particular was a problem for me. I felt like I wasn't cooling very efficiently, probably because I was literally soaked to the bone. The run passed through Angel Stadium between miles 10 and 11, which was a neat experience, but also a bit problematic since running on the wet cindery dirt stuff they use on a baseball diamond was slippery, and it clung to my decidedly not trail shoes for a good while afterward. \n\nAt mile 12, I was peaking, because I knew I was close and could hang on. I wasn't in the pain cave, but I was at the limit of what my legs and lungs had in them. It's no surprise that this was my fastest mile. I just focused on keeping pace with the twin Tinkerbells in front of me. I saw my family in the crowd just before 13 miles and took that as the final boost across the line.\n\nFor fueling, I consumed 3 GUs, at 3, 7, and 10 miles. I walked a few steps to take two drinks of water at every aid station besides the first.\n\n### Post-race\nI knew I hadn't made my A goal when I finished, but I just saved it on my watch and didn't look at it until I had recovered my senses a bit. Better to enjoy the jubilation of finishing for a few minutes before judging myself for how well I did. Eventually, I did look. My B goal was to beat my lifetime PR set in 2011, and I missed it by just about a minute. At the finish line, again, I can't understate how wet it was. I looked and felt like I'd come out of a pool. Sticky sticky sticky. The race organizers declared Red Flag conditions shortly after I finished, so it was also getting really hot. I believe it was the hottest day of 2024 in Anaheim by a good margin, well over 100F later in the day. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the event. I think the combination of the tough weather conditions and my decision to waste too much energy in the first 5 miles cost me the PR, but I'm not mad about it. I came very very close to matching much younger me in decidedly difficult conditions, so I'm actually really proud of myself. \n\nNext up: I'm registered for CIM in December, so I'm looking forward to that after I spend this week recovering. I have a Turkey Trot in November that I'll probably use as a tune-up if training is on track.\n\nThanks for reading, feedback welcome!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "A couple months ago, at one of our Thursday pub runs, my friend Mary mentioned she was running the Lock 2 Lock Half Marathon, which was last Saturday, September 7, so I decided to sign up, too. Oops, the half was sold out, so I signed up for the marathon. This is one of those things that happens at the Thursday pub runs. There's something about the pub conversation that leads us to sign up for the dumbest things.\n\nBut this wasn't dumb. My last marathon was almost 2 years ago - oh hey, I did a [race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/yhwaau/the_marine_corps_marathon_an_expected_pr/) of it - and with the way my year has been going, that PR was looking more and more like low hanging fruit.\n\n**Training**  \nGenerally speaking, I like to be in shape to run any race, up to 50 miles or even 100k, on less than a week's notice (you never know what I'll sign up for on any random Thursday). This involves maintaining my weekly mileage at 40+ and running an ultra every month or so. I don't train for any specific distance. Almost all of my runs are easy runs, although there was a group of us doing hell repeats, sorry, **hill** repeats on a 13% grade 1.6 mile hill every Tuesday this summer. I needed the downhill training, they needed the uphill training, so it worked out nicely.\n\nThe Lock 2 Lock Marathon has about 125 feet of elevation in the whole thing, so that downhill training really paid off!\n\n**Race Day**  \nThe weather was cool, but rain was in the forecast. I didn't pay attention to the rain part, though. Just the cool part.\n\nI ate breakfast - homemade yogurt with blueberries and hot honey is my daily breakfast, and I added on a gas station donut for good measure, and waited for Mary and Ashley to show up so we could carpool. I drove us out to the race location near Williamsport, Maryland.\n\nThe race itself is on the C&O Canal towpath - the same towpath on which I ran my [100 miler in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cg4exm/co_canal_100_miler_the_manidokan_factor/). It's flat and 185 miles long, and for some reason, people don't like running on it. I love it. The half marathon is 6.56 miles out and back from Lock 44 to Lock 43 on the canal. The marathon course does the out and back twice. Truly a mental challenge. I mean, I don't think it is, really, but that's what people who don't like running on the towpath say.\n\nMy B goal was to PR (beat 3:42:02), and my A goal was to go sub 3:30, which meant maintaining an 8:00 min/mile pace (or a little faster to have a margin of safety and for GPS quirks). I have a bit of a reputation of being an absolute rock-solid pacer (especially on a flat course), so I knew I had to live up to that.\n\nI won't keep you in suspense - I didn't *quite* make the A goal. That pacing, though...\n\n**Mile Splits:**  \nMile 1: 7:55  \nMile 2: 7:58  \nMile 3: 7:58  \nMile 4: 8:02  \nMile 5: 8:00  \nMile 6: 7:51  \nMile 7: 7:54  \nMile 8: 7:53  \nMile 9: 7:56  \nMile 10: 7:58  \nMile 11: 7:57  \nMile 12: 7:57  \nMile 13: 7:59  \nMile 14: 7:51  \nMile 15: 8:00  \nMile 16: 7:55  \nMile 17: 8:02  \nMile 18: 7:50  \nMile 19: 7:50  \nMile 20: 7:59  \nMile 21: 7:48  \nMile 22: 7:54  \nMile 23: 8:05  \nMile 24: 8:37  \nMile 25: 8:46  \nMile 26: 8:52  \nMile 0.2 (or so):  8:05 pace\n\nOfficial time was 3:31:59.7\n\nSo what went wrong? Well, first of all, I'm satisfied with this time. I absolutely crushed this race, and I'm very happy with the way I was pacing it for the first 23 miles. But yeah, there was a bit of a breakdown at the end. I knew what it was as soon as it started to set in: I didn't get enough calories. I was light headed and nauseous. In fact, I'm impressed that my pace stayed below a 9:00 minute mile, considering how awful I felt. Why did I not have enough calories? Well I brought 4 gels with me, and the plan was to have one every 5 miles starting at mile 5. That means no gel at mile 25, but I figured that's close enough to the end of the race that it will have barely kicked in by the time I finish, so what's the point? Well, I really could have used a fifth gel around mile 22 or 23. So, lesson learned: bring an extra gel. Alternatively, eat a second donut before the race.\n\nNot as much of a factor physically, but more mentally, was the rain, which started about 5 miles in and didn't let up much until just before I finished. It didn't affect me directly, I mean running in the rain is quite nice, but I occasionally have a problem when my shoes (Brooks Adrenalines) get wet - the inserts start sliding around underneath my feet. I've never had it as bad as it was Saturday. By the time I'd finished, the heel of my right insert had started to come out of my shoe. The left insert had rotated 90 degrees, so it cradled my foot sideways, like a saddle. The toe was sticking up out of the right side of the shoe and rubbing up against the inside of my ankle, and the heel was out on the left side, rubbing the outside of my ankle.\n\nHere are pics from two days after the race:  \n[Outside of ankle](https://i.imgur.com/0yGlM59.jpeg)  \n[Inside of ankle](https://i.imgur.com/aqGYG3K.jpeg)\n\nOuch. And yeah, it hurt while I was running, too. There was also the fact that I was running basically without an insert, except for the part of the insert that passed under my arch. Believe it or not, this didn't really slow me down. It just pissed me off, and it was raining, and my blood sugar was low. So yeah, I'm pretty okay with those last 3 miles coming in under 9 minutes.\n\nBrooks customer service suggested Shoe Goo to prevent future occurrences, in case this happens to anyone else. I would suggest to them that running shoes should be designed to occasionally get wet (this pair is almost brand new), and there should be some friction between the insert and the inside of the shoe. Both surfaces are unnaturally smooth, so it's no surprise that they slip around each other when they get wet. I'm on probably my 60th pair of Adrenalines, and I've had this problem before, but never this bad.\n\nBut I was happy to finish, and as I said, very pleased with my time. I can add another PR to this year's victories. And as someone who used to run 5 hour marathons, I can say that even though it's harder to run faster, the key is that you don't have to do it for as long."

It lets the mods group posts into Collections.  We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users.  We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed.  Here's the link to the wiki with a list of the current Collections.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/collections/\n\nPlease note, Collections only works for New Reddit and the Reddit mobile app for iOS.\n\n\n\n__________\n\n###**Using r/running**\n\n\n\nThe mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*\n\nThe mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.\n\nRegardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.\n\nWe are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.\n\n_____\n\n\n###**Recurring Threads**\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).\n\nHere are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  \n\n*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by \"Hot\" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by \"New\" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*\n\n* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!\n\n* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.\n\n* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11p5t2y/the_weekly_training_thread/)\n\n* [Miscellaneous Monday General Chit-Chat (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11q6loo/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat/)\n\n* [Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11pzhm1/lil_race_report_thread//)\n\n* [Super Moronic Monday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11r1unr/super_moronic_monday_your_weekly_tuesday_stupid/)\n\n* [Run Nutrition Tuesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11qw01m/tuesday_shoesday/)\n\n* [Tuesday Shoesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11kprum/tuesday_shoesday/)\n\n* [Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11rlh6u/lurkers_wednesday/)\n\n* [What Are You Wearing Wednesday Weekly Gear Thread (Wednesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11rlh72/what_are_you_wearing_wednesday_weekly_gear_thread/)\n\n* [Weekly Complaints & Confessions Thread (Thursdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11st6vl/weekly_complaints_confessions_thread/)\n\n* [Photo Friday (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11tpy47/its_photo_friday_lets_see_your_running_pictures/)\n\n* [The Weekend Thread (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11tovgi/the_weekend_thread_17th_march_2023/)\n\n* [Race Roll Call (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11tghhm/race_roll_call/)\n\n* [Social Saturday (Saturdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11udsi1/social_saturday/)\n\n* [Monthly Updates & Check In Thread (Last Day of the Month)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/10qm510/january_monthly_updates_check_in_thread/)\n_____\n\n###**Rules**\nWe have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.\n\n **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  \n\nThis sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.\n\nIf you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Current MPW + pace\n\n* Previous peak MPW\n\n* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed\n\n* Goals (including specific races)\n\n* Previous PRs\n\n* Other things you think might be helpful to include\n\nBelow are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:\n\n* \"Does anyone else...\" type posts?\n\n* \"Is X a good time for...?\" posts\n\n* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).\n\n* If your question can be asked in one sentence.\n\n* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.\n\n* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.\n\n* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  \n\n* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.\n\nFinally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.\n\n\n **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  \n\nWhile there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  \n\nThere is a big difference between \"Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?\" and \"My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?\" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.\n\nAlso, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.\n\n_____________________\n\n\nFinally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.\n\n###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**"

At first I don't have any plans to start running, but since I got a daily suggested workout notifications all the time, I thought what the heck. I also tried Garmin's coach features and I follow them by heart. Despite its limitations, I would say that Garmin Coach, especially coach Dan was really helpful for a beginner runner like me. \n\n\n\nTraining as an overweight person, with little to none exercising experience was a pain. I got some injuries every time I tried to run more and more. I guess I over trained myself. Thankfully from the redditors in this subreddit, I found the myrtle routine which helped me alot, along with some visits to physiotherapists.  \n\n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nI am living an hour away from Stockholm, hence my friends and I arrived there 3 hours before our start time. It was really fun to see a lot of people coming in, with some expo going on. \n\nAs this is my first race, I thought to just wear my running clothes so that I don't need to change at the place. It was a bad idea. The day was hot, and I'm sweating like crazy before the start of the race. \n\nTwo hours before the start, we started to get into our running shoes and wait in the shades before leaving the race-pack to the organizers and start to wait in our starting group. As we are doing our first half marathon, we got the last group. It took us about half-an-hour to wait from the first time the elite group started running.\n\n\n\n### Race\n\nI have said to myself to start slow, as in 7:30 to 7:40, to keep my energy level high until after midway. But guess what, everyone was so quick that I unfortunately got carried away with it as well. My plan was to maintain my HR to be less than 170, but well, it got to 180+ real quick.... I was thinking to slow down, but I thought okay, I can still maintain my pace and I was not feeling that exhausted. Let's just go.....\n\n\n\nStockholm is rather hilly. I knew that from the start so I need to be smart enough to pace myself. The first hill was at the 3rd Kilometer. It was hot, hilly and the sun was at our face. Not gonna lie that it was a pain. I was so glad to finally reached the 1st water station,  and they were kind enough to provide us with some water shower, energy drinks and normal water station.\n\n\n\nKilometers 4 - 10 went by quite okay as we were battling the hills and some sun but as the day goes by, it got better as the temperature drops slowly. The thing is, I bought a drink gel when I was training, and I was trying several flavours. I didn't buy them again as I still have 1 left. BUT, it was something with caffeine, which I have never tried before. I never drink coffee as I have a weak stomach, hence have little to none caffeine throughout my life. \n\n\n\nAs I thought to refuel, I thought ah the gel would be really nice for me. But bam, I suddenly felt my heart rate was exceedingly high, like 190++ high. That occurred to me at km 13 hence I need to walk a bit to try to bring my HR lower. I don't want to have any heart problems from this event lol.\n\n\n\nAfter the little incident, I continued to run, after KM 17, my mind was slowly hitting me, on how everything on my body was so tired. I have trained a long run before, but 18 KM was my longest run. Hence I was entering some uncharted territory there.\n\n\n\nI am really happy that I could still push through, and even got a burst of energy when doing my last kilometer. I got too carried away and sprinted a bit further than I expected. I should have just sprinted the last 300-400 meters, but nooo.. I started to sprint when I was 800meters out. And of course, I could not follow through, hence I walked a bit to regain my breath. well, lesson learned.\n\n\n\nBut all in all, I was quite happy that I managed to finish the race. It was not sub 2.5 hours, but hey! it's my first one, and I can finish it! \n\n\n\n\n\n### Post-race\n\nPost-race, we get into some asian buffet and it was fun to chat with my wife and friends and telling stories about the race itself. \n\n\n\nMy feet hurts, or rather sore, and I got a small blister. But considering that when I was training, I always have problems with my knee, I thought that this was a win for me! No knee pain!\n\n\n\nThis week, I doubt that I will do a lot of running, maybe some. But, this will not be my last, as hopefully many more will come.\n\n\n\nThank you all for reading this, and thanks for all your suggestions in this subreddit. You guys are awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

I unfortunately had to have my ankle replaced last year at 35, something I put off because it meant hanging up my running shoes. I ran a final half marathon early last year and did a farewell 5k along the ocean just prior to surgery. I thought I’d made my peace. \n\nComing up on a year since surgery and I’m really struggling without running. I recently learned about anti-gravity treadmills and am curious if this could be a good replacement for actual running. Those that have used one, how real does it feel? Is it hard work/does it give the feel of a workout? As long as my body is not a limiting factor, does the machine run for long enough that I could get a few miles in? Any cons?

Now with two little kids, though, I have even less time and even less margin for a poor diet and weaker training plans. Toward the end of last year, I noticed that I might be going up a pant size. I was feeling doughy, sluggish, and all-around poor, both physically and mentally. The littlest one didn't sleep until roughly last week, so part of the issue was 16 months of terrible sleep. But I knew I needed to make a change. I counted calories and bought a treadmill, dropping 15 pounds from January to May. But as I got to the meat of the summer, my training started to fall off again, with lots of travel disrupting my runs/diet, and a ridiculously hot summer making my short run window (afternoon nap time) unbearable. I think I did enough to give myself a decent baseline, though, and although I had some bad runs in the two weeks prior, I did manage a 7+ mile run with hills that made me feel like I was capable of pushing myself in a race again.\n\n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nThe race started at 6, but I was leg three and estimated I'd start closer to 7:30. I debated sleeping in a bit, but didn't know the course or area very well and didn't want to get stuck without being able to get to my starting spot. Luckily, the race is small and the roads don't close, so getting around wasn't an issue. I'll remember that for the future! I premade a bowl of bran and muesli, plus put my coffee in the microwave overnight, and got about 5 hours of rest on the couch (sleeping in my race clothes, as I did not trust my morning brain to remember to put on shorts). 3 minutes before my alarm, I woke up and was out the door in 10 minutes.\n\nI headed to the start in my cozy sweats while other runners were shivering in their marathon gear. I caught up with 2 of the other 3 teammates (our fourth leg slept in, fair enough). The first leg was only 3.8 miles, so I figured I'd head down to my spot after the gun. Thanks to the weird loop, I was able to yell out of my car some encouragement to the Leg 1 runner, then stopped at a gas station to make a quick 'deposit' in a private room on my way to my spot.\n\nMy leg started at a camping spot/small concert venue right on the river, which was gorgeous in the morning. The mist hung over the water and separated the sparkling water from the pale pink sky while the muddy banks muted all the sounds of the morning. In the quiet, I was able to stretch and calm my nerves. I ran into some people camping who ended up being fellow alumni of my undergrad, which was two states away so it was a cool coincidence. After a bit, runners started filling in and gave the spot more of a race day atmosphere.\n\nWe looked up the winning times from the last two years and had a hope that we would be able to win, depending on who registered. Sadly, I noticed at this spot the presence of two guys wearing college running tops, so I figured we were no better than 3rd. But, our real goal was to get an award, which was reserved for the top three relay teams, so it was still on the table.\n\nMinor disaster 1: As I was changing into my proper gear, my 'good' socks each had a big hole! I always wear two pairs which has decreased my blister rate from near-constant to almost never, so I wasn't completely up a creek, but luckily I found a second pair in my trunk.\n\nMinor disaster 2: As I was tying my shoes for the final time, my top eyelet ripped! These were sale shoes, but I liked them and was worried about my foot slipping too much. But, that was all I had, so I hoped it would hold ok.\n\nSome family of our team came down to support, having seen the handoff from Leg 1 to 2, which was a fun way to kill the final 15 minutes or so. The first runner through was a relay, also wearing a D1 running tank. So, they weren't gonna be caught. The next was a marathoner, followed by another relay team (also a collegiate runner). Then several more marathoners, and then a few more relays! We weren't in third, or even top 5! I was getting nervous, and I knew our Leg 2 had some IT band issues, and I hoped he hadn't gotten injured.\n\nLuckily, I saw him coming around the bend and got ready. I kinda fumbled the hand off (they gave us a running belt with a bib w/ chip attached, so I had to strap it on while holding my phone). I decided last minute not to carry my water and stash my car key in my shorts, but decided it was wise to bring my phone in case my family didn't make it to my finish spot (with two little kids, it was a big possibility).\n\n### Race\n\nThe first mile was on gravel, which wasn't ideal, but it was pretty compact and my adrenaline carried me to a very quick start. The first mile is flat, followed by the big hill that everyone talks about with this race. I knew roughly the distance and slope, and trained on hills to prep, but I had never actually seen it irl. I'm glad, as I pushed up the hill with more of an attacking mindset than I would have if I had been trying to anticipate where it leveled out again. I passed two people going up, which also gave me a boost.\n\nOnce at the top, I had assumed the road would level out to pretty flat running. But the elevation map misled me! It was much more undulating than I anticipated, so while I was able to get some pretty good pace from miles 2 to mile 4, the little hills started adding up. Mile 5 was net-uphill, and I started to feel the wall. Luckily, there was a woman in front of me that I spied around mile 3.5 and I made it my goal to catch her. I finally passed her around mile 5, so while I did stop for a sip of Gatorade I was quick through it so I could stay ahead.\n\nMile 6 was rough. An unexpected second hill took my legs, and I would have probably crashed had it not been for my buddy driving back and forth with his family, jumping out at nearly every driveway to cheer me on. He was supposed to anchor us, but hurt his foot, so he took the role of coach/cheerleader, and did a great job! This was another perk of not closing these roads - you could get some minimal support, but far more than most rural races I've done! \n\nI came into the finish without any ability to kick/sprint, but I still feel like I finished strong enough. I had passed 5 people and got us into 3rd for the relay, so I felt good about my contribution. This hand off went better than mine, and my family had managed to make it in to cheer me in. After some rehashing with Legs 1 and 2, we all headed to the finish, leaving my car, my change of clothes, my snacks, and my comfy sandals all behind. That's a mistake I won't make again.\n\nThis was a low-key race, but done well. Not a ton of flourish at the finish, but since it was small they could call in each team/runner. Our anchor had gotten us into 3rd as a team (and we only got beat by two full marathon runners), so we got to celebrate hitting all our real goals! \n\n### Post-race\n\nI had to get my car, but luckily they had shuttles running and I chatted with a volunteer the whole way. It was fun driving against the running traffic and cheering for them out the windows when we could, too. \n\nWe want to run again next year, and we've decided to make sub-3 our team goal. My leg was the only one on pace for that this year, but everyone else was fairly close. I don't know if I want to run my hills again, but we've got a year to decide.\n\nOverall, Heart of America is a tough race, with gravel in parts, significant hills, and minimal (but great) support. It is a Boston qualifier, but you'd be a dummy to try to qualify here given the difficulty of the course. It was worth it, though, if you just want a good, solid challenge. I'll run it again, but only as a relay member!\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

        "Texto": "Before signing up for the Leadville 100 Trail Run, I hadn’t run more than a half marathon. I found myself spending a lot of time surfing the web, trying to figure out everything I needed to get ready for this race (and spending a lot of $ trying out different products). I tried a lot of different brands and products, so I thought it might be helpful to put my entire gear list/resource list together for those looking to run Leadville 100 or their first 100-miler. Obviously, it's always personal preference, but hopefully this will help someone as much as it would have helped me :)\n\n**Running Coach: Lindsey Herman, Running Wild:**  \nFirst things first—if the ultra-running space is new to you, get yourself a coach! Like I said, I had never run more than a half marathon before starting my training for this, so I definitely needed guidance and a training program. Lindsey tailored a program for me that suited my lifestyle, and I went through training injury-free!\n\n**Nutrition Coach: Kylee Van Horn, Fly Nutrition:**  \nMy fueling plan for this race was crucial to finishing. Kylee educated me on how much I needed to consume every hour of my race. I learned so much in this process. I never got sick during Leadville, and I really attribute that to having a solid plan going in.\n\n**Watch:** **Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar - $570**:\n\nI spent a ton of time researching watches. I was debating between the Garmin and COROS. I ended up going with Garmin, as I felt the GPS was more accurate (did a lot of reading on this). A lot of people go with COROS due to battery life. I did the 100 miler with my Garmin and had 20% battery left after 29 hours. I did some research ahead of time, and turned on the battery saving feature for GPS (still really accurate), turned off the Gesture feature, turned off the Bluetooth connection and turned the brightness down to 20%.\n\n**Hat: Janji AFO Hyperlight Cap – $38:**  \nI LOVE this hat—it’s super light, moisture-wicking, and can easily be stashed in your vest or pack.\n\n**Sunglasses: Blenders Eclipse Sunglasses – $59:**  \nWhen you’re in the sun for hours, especially at high altitude, it’s crucial to protect your eyes (sunburned eyes make it difficult to see at night!). These sunglasses don’t slide and provide great coverage, including the sides of my eyes.\n\n**Sports Bra: Fleo Maeve Sports Bra – $54:**  \nThis is seriously the BEST sports bra I’ve used. I chafe really badly from sports bras, but this one is so soft and doesn’t give me any problems.\n\n**Rain Coat: Outdoor Research Aspire II GORE-TEX Jacket – $155 (on sale):**  \nI spent a lot of time researching rain jackets because I read so many horror stories about people having to drop out of the race due to sudden weather changes and the inability to stay warm. What I learned is that nice rain jackets are pricey. I didn’t want to spend hundreds, so I tried this one, and it has kept me warm and dry during rain and snow training runs (I got lucky and had no rain during Leadville!). Definitely get something with GORE-TEX to stay dry.\n\n**Running Shorts: Janji 7″ Pace Short – $72:**  \nI’ve tried a lot of different running shorts, and I fell in love with these. They don’t slide up, and they dry super fast. They also have multiple pockets so you can stash gels and wrappers while you’re on the go. I find it annoying to make sure wrappers don’t fall out of my running vest, so I love the pockets for my trash.\n\n**Socks: Injinji Trail Midweight Mini Crew Socks ($16) and Balega Blister Resist Socks ($20):**  \nNot going to lie—my feet got pretty messed up during this race (I had to remove toenails afterward). However, I don’t think it was due to my socks but more because my toes jammed into the front of my shoes and hit rocks. Other than my toenails, I was mostly blister-free, and my feet felt the best while wearing these two pairs. I tried about four different brands in total and did get blisters with the other brands.\n\n**Underwear: Balanced Tech Moisture Wicking Underwear – $33:**  \nNo one really talks about underwear, but they suck if you don’t have the right ones! The last thing you need is to be adjusting them while you’re trying to run. I found these on Amazon, and I love them. They don’t move around, which is my favorite thing about them.\n\n**Trekking Poles and Pole Bag: Black Diamond Distance FLZ Trekking Poles ($160) and Ounergy Storage Bag ($15):**  \nI went back and forth on whether I needed trekking poles. I will say that it’s worth spending a little on them if you decide to use them. Why? You want a pair that’s light and folds down. It’s really personal preference whether you use them. I found them super helpful when going up and down Hope Pass. Other than that, I found poles to be a bit in the way, especially when trying to eat while walking with poles in hand. I bought a cheap pole bag on Amazon and used mini carabiners to attach it to the back of my running vest.\n\n**Trail Shoes: Topo Athletic Ultraventure 3 Trail Running Shoe ($150) and Road Shoes: Brooks Ghost 16 ($140):**  \nMost of my training was done in these shoes. I sized up a half size, and they both worked great. These have a nice wide toe box, which I loved since I have wide feet. The Topos also act as a hybrid shoe, meaning you can run on trails and roads if needed. They have good traction, but it’s not overly aggressive. I used the Brooks when training on roads or easy trails. I also tried Hokas (both road and trail), but I found them too narrow. However, they would be amazing for people with narrower feet. Honestly, the shoe debate is still open, as my feet were pretty destroyed after the 100, mostly due to toenail issues.\n\n**Headphones: Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds – $200**  \nThese headphones worked for the entire 29 hours and 23 minutes of my race. I ran with one earbud (which I think is the best option so you can hear your surroundings), while the other one was charging in the case. If you start with them fully charged, each earbud will last 9 hours, and the charging case will charge them back to full by the time you need to switch. The only downside is that the charging case is a little bulky, but I just shoved it in my running vest and forgot about it.\n\n**Running Vest: Salomon Sense Pro 5L Hydration Vest – $160**  \nI used this vest for all of my training and for the race. It fits A LOT for its size. I had my two bottles (that come with it), my nutrition for at least 12 miles, another liter of water in the back, a small first aid kit, my headphone case, a rain jacket, a beanie, gloves, and other small items. I think it’s a pretty good vest overall, and it worked well for me.\n\n**Running Light: Kogalla RA Single Pack (1) – $180**\n\nThis light will light up your life—seriously! I got it because it’s a waist light, and a headlamp can sometimes make me a little nauseous from the bouncing. This light will last up to around 12 hours on a medium setting, which provides plenty of light. It lights up a pretty good radius around you, which is really nice when running on technical terrain. The only downside is that you have to run with the battery pack it plugs into. I used my flip belt to hold the magnet that attaches to the light, and I shoved the battery pack in the back of the belt, which worked well for me. Just make sure you don’t leave the battery pack on when not using it, otherwise it will die. I carried an extra headlamp with extra batteries just in case this happened (and it did).\n\n**Nutrition preference items** (this really all depends on your personal preference, but this is what worked well for me. I tried a lot of different types of nutrition during training, which is super important so you can see what works for your gut):\n\n**Bare Nutrition** **Mango Go Gel – $30 for 10**:  \nI love the consistency of this gel. It’s more of a liquid than a gel, making it super easy to go down.\n\n**Gu Gels/Salted Watermelon – $39 for 24**:  \nI love the flavor of these, and they are definitely a cheaper option to buy in bulk.\n\n**GU Energy Roctane Ultra Endurance Electrolyte Capsules – $9 for 50 capsules**:  \nYou’ll want an option with water only and want to be sure you’re getting enough sodium. I would supplement these when I wasn’t drinking electrolyte mix.\n\n**Skratch Labs Hydration Powder – $42 for a big bag**:  \nI tried a few different electrolyte mixes, and this one worked the best for my stomach. It has a super light flavor with 20 grams of carbs in each serving.\n\nIt’s also important to fuel with real food as well. This is really a personal preference, but Fig Newtons, tortillas with a little peanut butter and jelly, and Bare Nutrition Go Bars (link below) worked best for me.\n\n**Other important items to consider carrying or making sure your crew has** (you can find a lot of this on Amazon!):\n\n**Extra batteries for headlamp**\n\n**Body Glide** for body and feet: This stuff is amazing. It worked like a charm for me!\n\n**Cool Rag**: When it was hot, this worked well for me. My crew would give me a new one at each aid station I saw them, and then I would dunk it in streams when I could and keep it on my head under my hat. It really saved me in the heat.\n\n**Race Belt**: This was nice to have for extra storage for gel wrappers, my light battery, etc. I used a FlipBelt.\n\n**Small First Aid Kit**: They make these for running. It’s always smart to have one.\n\n**Pepto**: My lifesaver for preventing a nervous stomach.\n\n**Tums**: I got nauseous sometimes, and this would kick it for the most part.\n\n**Extra Strength Tylenol**: I took this at mile 40, and it really helped with achiness.\n\n**Voltaren**: My crew would rub my legs down with this at every aid station I saw them. It really helps with aches.\n\n**Sunscreen**: Have your crew spray you each time they see you, or carry a small one and make sure to re-apply!\n\n**Long Sleeve Shirt**: It’s always smart to have an extra layer with you. I also carried my raincoat.\n\n**Beanie**: I used a regular Carhartt Beanie when it got cold.\n\n**Gloves**: I used Smartwool Cozy Gloves. They dried quickly if they got wet and were breathable while still keeping my hands warm.\n\n**Wet Wipes:** A must-have for everyone 🙂\n\nHopefully this information will help you as you plan for your upcoming ultra! I know it would have been helpful for me 🙂 Happy Trails!"

        "Texto": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Headlands 50k\n* **Date:** August 17, 2024\n* **Distance:** 31.46 miles \n* **Location:** Marin, CA \n* **Time:** 6:49:18\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Finish | *Yes* |\n| B | Have fun  | *Yes* |\n| C | Be able to run at the end   | *Yes* |\n| D | Sub 7h | *Yes* |\n\n### Training\nThis was my first ultra. It was a challenging first 50k with 6600 feet of elevation gain, but I picked it because it’s close to where I live, I was familiar with a lot of the course already from hiking, and it’s absolutely gorgeous. \n\nI had completed two road marathons (Big Sur in 2023 and a solo “race” in 2020) prior to signing up so I was confident I could cover the distance, but I made some shifts in mindset and training style to prep for a hilly trail race. I did minimal speed work, paid very little attention to pace, and did weekday runs based on time rather than distance. \n\nMy training structure was as follows: \n\nMonday: rest\n\nTuesday: 30-60 min trail run “warm-up” + hill/stair repeats - either 4-6 repeats of a half mile long hill doing 2 mins running/2 mins power hiking, 4-8 reps of a long staircase in SF (Lyon Street Steps iykyk) or 4-6 short hill sprints \n\nWednesday: 45 min Peloton bike + 20 min core strength OR 60-min full body strength \n\nThursday: 60-120 min easy trail run with as many hills as I can find \n\nFriday: 45-60 min full body strength or yoga OR extra rest day as needed  \n\nSaturday: Long trail run (longest trail run was 22 miles, and I ran the SF Marathon on road 3 weeks before the 50k). I ran different sections of the course a few times including one 30k trail race which was super fun. \n\nSunday: hike, stair repeats, or yoga \n\nI averaged 20-30 mile weeks, capping out at 45 three weeks before the race. I have been pretty injury-prone in the past so I’ve stuck with lower volume, not running two days in a row, and making sure to prioritize strength/mobility/yoga and cross training. However, this was my first training cycle without a single niggle or injury scare (other than a few minor ankle rolls on trail) so I’m feeling more confident about the prospect of increasing my volume for future training cycles. Turns out running on softer surfaces is kinder to your body, who’da thunk! \n\n### Taper/pre-race\nI did a 3-week taper following the SF Marathon on 7/28. Wouldn’t rec a road marathon as your last long run, but I had deferred from last year and was going to lose the entry if I didn’t run, and it ended up being fine. \n\nOnly ended up doing 10- and 9-mile “long runs” plus lower volume of my usual weekly plan, an extra rest day per week, and my final day of strength training 1.5 weeks out. \n\nStarted carb loading 3 days before (anyone else hate carb loading?!), had rice and a fried egg with kimchi for dinner the night before, and two sourdough sandwiches with butter/jam and PB/maple syrup the morning of, plus a caffeinated Huma gel 15 mins before the start. \n\n### Race\nMy strategy for the race was to run the flats/downhills and put in a solid effort hiking the ups. I had 0 clue what time I might put up, so my goal going in was to finish before the 10-hour cutoff, but when I got ~halfway through the race I set an impromptu goal to get under 7 hours. \n\nThe weather was high 50s/low 60s, foggy, humid, and WET, which is uncommon for this time of year and was not in the weather forecast. It was misting or drizzling the whole time, and I was drenched after a couple hours (to the point where I was blowing on my phone to get the touch screen to work since there was no other way to dry it off). If I had known it was going to be so wet I would have brought an extra pair of socks and foot care supplies; I ended up with some blisters but thankfully they didn’t impact my race at all. Huge silver lining for me was not having to deal with any sun or heat as around half the race is pretty exposed. \n\nI bought gaiters mid training cycle but never tried them out and didn’t have issues with rocks etc in my shoes during training. I thought about wearing them for the race but in the spirit of “nothing new on race day” I did not, which was a mistake. I did get a bunch of rocks and pine needles/leaves in my shoes during the race (maybe from more people around agitating the trail? Or just luck…who knows) and had to stop around mile 14 to dump them out. \n\nFor fueling I took a Huma gel or Skratch/Clif chews every 45 mins (I had alarms set which I highly recommend). I also had 3 packs of Tailwind and went through one every ~2 hours. Alternated caffeinated and decaf fuel. I also took maybe 6-8 Salt Stick chews (green apple flavor, the best) on no particular schedule. I had a handful of pretzels at one aid station but otherwise stuck to what I brought - I was pretty nauseous early on in the race so didn’t want to mess with anything. I had a vest (Salomon Adv Skin 5) with two 500ml soft flasks and a bladder. I ran with the bladder about 1/3 full as “backup water” (also used to rinse off my hands after some tailwind refill mishaps lol) and refilled one or both of the flasks at most aid stations. Kind of a lot of water to be carrying but it’s personal preference for me - I would rather have the extra weight than run out of water. \n\nThe first 6 miles had some of the steepest climbs in the whole race, which I was prepared for but was still mentally tough before I was really warmed up. I used the mantra “it can’t always get worse” which helped a lot. This was also a coastal section with some of the best views, which were sadly blocked by the wall o’ fog. \n\nMiles 7-19 ticked by and included a long steady climb and a long gentle single-track downhill, the best I felt all day. Climbing back up through the redwoods all moody in the fog was so gorgeous. \n\nThe next two sections (miles 20-27) are two of my favorite trails, Matt Davis (downhill) and Steep Ravine (uphill), but at this point in the race they were really tough. Matt Davis is technical and steep with lots of switchbacks, roots, stairs, and rocks, which were pretty slippery given the weather. My legs were feeeeeling it at that point and I just tried to keep moving and blast music. I made a good effort hiking up Steep Ravine (and climbing the ladder!) but had a mini meltdown at the top when the last aid station before the finish was half a mile further than I thought and my music started glitching and everything was too wet to work for a few mins. Highest HR of the day was at that point. \n\nThe last ~4 miles were very forgiving all things considered, a bit muddy with some rutty trail but downhill and not too steep so I was in a good mood (#thingsdontalwaysgetworse)\nand able to cruise to the finish. Teared up a bit when my watch hit 30 miles bc how the heck did I get here?! I was by myself at this point so I was blasting music in my headphones and singing out loud. The switchbacks in the last 3/4 mile were obnoxious when I was actually feeling like I could run fast, but I pushed as hard as I could and sprinted across the finish line. \n\nHuge shoutout to all the volunteers who turned out on such a damp day!! Yall were so great, positive energy and kept everything running super smoothly. \n\n### Post-race \nLegs are pretty sore today (also my shoulders which is weird) but nothing too crazy. Currently lying in bed looking up 50 mile races……👀 \n"

I say generally because I did a lot more km's than what was in the plan except for the 2.5+ hour runs where I kept those to roughly the correct time. I started off the year doing 4 weeks of 100kms a week followed by a shorter week (70-80kms). I didn't include any specific workouts, just running whatever pace was comfortable on the day and just aiming for 100kms / 62 miles a week. During the week this was usually double run days of 7-8kms twice a day with a longer run on the weekend.\n\nThe training plan kicked off around April and while i kept my goal of 100kms a week, i started doing the interval and tempo sessions as stated in the plan. My sunday long runs were generally at least half marathon. My longest week was 138kms and shortest was 102. My longest run was 35kms and i did 5 x 30+kms runs during the plan. I also set new 5k pb (twice) a 10k pb and half mara pb during the 16 week training plan.\n\nMy reasoning for all the extra kms is in my previous full marathons I have felt very much underdone particularly in the last 10kms.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI started easing back the kms at week 14 with an 85km week. I've started developing a bit of plantar fasciitis in my left foot so that was a concern. It wasn't bothering me too much during training so i kept going with the plan, i just didn't do extra like i had been. Dinner was at 5pm and was plain white rice. Pre race brekky was 1 crumpet with vegemite and some electrolyte mix at 3am. Race start was 6am and i was staying in a hotel across the rd from the start (convenient!).\n\n# Race\n\nHad a goal of doing 5min splits for the first 5k and then judging how i felt. My ultimate goal was to finish without walking as I had not been able to do that in my previous fulls. During training a 5 min km felt very easy so i was thinking i could aim for 4:50-5:00. I found the 3:30 pacer at the start and stuck with the group for about 8kms before getting ahead.\n\nHad to stop for a toilet break at the 14k mark! Ended up about 4 mins behind the pacer at that point but was also running consistently in the 4:50 range so i stuck with that. My plantar started getting to the 4-5/10 pain level at the 19k mark but by 21k it had mostly gone away so i kept going.\n\nCaught up with the 3:30 pacer at the 29k mark and passed by. Got to 39k mark and my left hamstring cramped. I stopped for a bit and stretched, started running again for it to happen between 40-41k and then my right went also in the 41st km. I was able to pick up the pace in the last 600m or so to cross the line just outside my goal time.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI need to sort out the cramp issue. This was my 6th full and I have cramped in all of them. The difference with this one was that it was only my hamstrings where in previous fulls it has been hamstrings, quads, calves (basically everything south of my waist :) )\n\nI think this time was a muscle/strength issue rather than hydration?\n\nLooking back I believe I could/should have run in the 4:40-4:50 range. After the race i caught up with my wife and we went for a \\~6km walk to go get brekky. Aside from my hamstrings being a bit sore, my legs were fine and it felt like i'd done a fairly easy run. My previous full pb (also at this event) was 3:57 in 2022. In other good news it was my 1st full with absolutely no toe / toenail issues. I wore Asics metaspeed edge paris though I put a lot of this down to the time spent on my feet during training rather than the shoes themselves (they are very good however)\n\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

        "Texto": "Hi all.\n\n**First, some background information:**\n\nI am a seasoned runner with quite some experience at any distance from 5K to 60K, road and trail and I do have experience with minimalist shoes including huaraches and barefoot.\n\nTrying “weird” types of footwear is a sort of part-time hobby for me. Besides the above-mentioned minimalist shoes, I have run with classical “chucks” canvas sneakers (awesome, BTW), military boots and El Cheapo footwear just for the sake of it.\n\nBut the main idea behind trying minimalist footwear is to try to feel the same as our ancestors did, running in the same (or similar enough) shoes as they did.\n\nI am Dutch, but my roots are in the Valencian Community, Spain. In this region, the traditional popular footwear is the *espardenya* (*espardeña* in Spanish). I will add a few images as a reply later, with my own ones. They are similar to the Basque *alpargata* and similar footwear of other parts of Europe. The build is also similar to the *espadrille*, but the concept is different, as the *espadrille* encases the foot, while the espardenya not.\n\nHere the pertinent Wikipedia article, though it does not mention that we in Spain do differentiate among the styles and in the Valencian Community, only the corded ones are considered : [Wikipedia Espadrille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espadrille) (check out the Catalan volunteer).\n\n**So, what about running?**\n\nI have already done a few trials with these. The difficult part was figuring out the lacing technique. I use the traditional one (cross at the hell, cross at the front, pass under, bind around and lace). \n\nBut while nowadays the espardenya is used without socks, I use them with running socks, similarly to the Basque alpargatas, which are worn with woollen sock that are rolled over the laces. The socks help keeping the laces in place and also avoid abrasion. The esparto soles do not cause issues when walking, but they can cause serious pain when running. \n\nThe sole is \\~1 cm thick (less than half an inch) and there is no heel platform. It is thus a zero-drop shoe. The sole is very flexible, yet durable, esparto grass is astonishingly sturdy and resistant to abrasion from sand. Modern espardenyes also use rubber reinforcements that were meant to keep the rolled cord in place and add extra durability. Sometimes at the cost of some flexibility. \n\nLike minimalist “barefoot” shoes like the Merrel Glove or the traditional Huarache, a forefoot strike can be used with espardenyes, given their flexibility and the lack of a heel or any other different parts of the sole. But unlike barefoot footwear, they are quite forgiving and can be used in a usual, more \"midfoot\" sort of strike.\n\nOn the trail they allow a similar technique than with minimalist shoes with the sole “hugging” the terrain. Unlike minimalist shoes, though, you can safely step on stones or roots. \n\nHeel slip has, unexpectedly, not been an issue, even though I felt like the heel piece was a bit loose. I assume that this has to do with mi gait.\n\nI haven't had any accident or fall yet, so that I can't tell how they would behave. All of my tests have been done in our, rather forgiving, Holland landscape, lacking any real technical trails, but I would love to hear from anybody out there who has had experience with similar shoes.  \n  \nI would love to hear about people with similar interests and experiences in running with these or other traditional shoes. I think that there are runners in South America racing with their own “alpargatas” and also in Asia.\n\n"

        "Texto": "I've looked through the post hisotry looking for discussions on zero drop shoes and I haven't seen \\_much\\_ discussion on it for new runners.\n\n  \nI ran many years ago but used to always get injured and eventually gave up and moved into strength training and cycling instead. I decided to go back to running just before covid and got my gait screened to find out I both over and under-pronate moving between the two when I run: I strike the ground on the outside of my foot and roll inwards. I got trainers which made my ankle stay in place the best when I run (Mizuno Wave Inspire 14) and I found they were pretty decent....then I got covid and all exercise went out the window. Roll on 4 years and having lost all strength, muscle and any form of fitness (although I have had a kid 9 months ago!) I am finally back to wanting to run but I'm a big fan of zero drop shoes hence this post.\n\n  \nAs someone prone to injury I am concerned about trying to run in my vibram five fingers or merrell vapor gloves but I subscribe to the theory of efficient movement imparted by zero drop. Since I am starting over again with the none 2 run program, I am thinking I am in a good position to start running in the zero drops....or am I opening myself up to injury here BECAUSE I am only starting again? I generally use minimal shoes in daily life but when I go for dog walks I use my hiking boots (I live in Ireland so it's often wet outside) so not sure I have built up the stamina and calf strength but isn't that what the noob programs do as well as build running endurance?\n\n  \nSo my question is do I start the noob program as a beginner runner in my zero drops, do I stick with my clunky trainers that I know keep my ankles aligned or do I switch it up? Of course I could try an intermediate shoe or low drop like 4mm or I believe some New Balance shoes are 6mm? I am a 38 yo female with dodgy hips and about 10 years ago my physio told me to just not run but I do believe it's because I was heel striking with long strides and going hard as much as possible so the usual youthful keeness mistakes. My ambitious plans are to run a marathon next year and plan to accompany this restart to running with pilates, yoga and strength training."

Cross-training: Stationary recumbent cycle.\n\n7th marathon overall. First marathon since 2007 Big Sur. Ran 2006 San Francisco Marathon (5:45:05). Ran previously \"To Finish\" 🐢 First time-goal marathon 🎯\n\nUnder-trained, unintentionally 😝 Followed program day-by-day (e.g., Tue = run 40-50 minutes). However, belatedly realized I had trained at too slow of a *run pace* for the run/walk intervals. My misunderstanding. [Fellrnr's wiki page \"Galloway Run Walk Paces\" helpfully clarifies I should have trained for a race-day *run pace* of 8:59/mile (when using 60-second walk breaks every 2:30)](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Galloway#Galloway_Run_Walk_Paces), not the 10:15/mile run pace I had used. I had misinterpreted two sections on page 43 of \"Marathon: You Can Do It!\": 1) \"For a time goal of 4:40, run each mile repeat in 10:15, using a run-walk-run strategy of 2:30/walk 30 seconds.\"; and 2) On marathon overall pace running: \"...run 1-3 miles at 10:50, using a run-walk-run ratio of run 2:30/walk 1 minutes. This tells you what it's like to run at marathon goal pace.\" I mixed up the mile repeat \"overall mile pace\" (i.e., 10:15) as the *run pace* to use to get the \"overall marathon mile pace\" (e.g., 10:50). \n\nLearned something new, so not viewing it as a failure. Feel some embarrassment at not catching it sooner 🫢 However, still finished my first marathon in 17 years, with a course PR ✅ 🎉\n\nTrained moderately with hill repeats early-on for 3 weekends, then on flats for remaining weeks. Have ready access to foothills. Given the challenging hills of the San Francisco Marathon, I might have scheduled more hill repeats on non-long run weekends.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nStayed at Hyatt Regency San Francisco ([Costco Travel & Citi 20% cash back - Digital Costco Shop Card promotional offer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/1art540/costco_travel_citi_20_back/)).\n\nBibs mailed (so we had them for the Saturday morning 5K fun run).\n\nSaturday: Walked the 5K fun run. Attended post-shakeout event at Equator Coffee. Got swag at the expo. Relaxed at the hotel and watched Olympics for the rest of the day. Note: Two items had not arrived due to logistics issues: 1) I ❤️ SF tee shirt (via promo registration code SweetValentine); and 2) Bay Bridge (SF/ Oakland) Challenge medals. Staff instructed us to email *customersupport at* [*thesfmarathon.com*](http://thesfmarathon.com) .\n\nFood: [Brenda's French Soul Food](https://frenchsoulfood.com/) (lunch); [Lunette Cambodia](https://www.instagram.com/lunette_cambodia/), in the Ferry Building (dinner); hydrating with water & a Clif Bar (evening). Mediocre sleep \\~10:30-3:30 a.m. (Garmin sleep score = 60).\n\nCorral C. Weather pleasantly humid & cool: 13° C/55° F and 92% humidity. Rehearsed my time goal: \\~10:50/mile.\n\n# Race\n\n## Miles 1-3 (Starting Line to Marina Green)\n\nStarting line ChronoTrack timing mats & FlashPoint stands read my bib at 5:26 a.m. Listened to Desean Terry narrate Raymond Arsenault's \"Arthur Ashe: A Life\". Dark. Crowded. A handful of homeless persons lie unmoving under blankets. A few clusters of spectators cheer. Avoid the cobble stones & embedded roadway rails if possible; the dark makes them slightly treacherous. The ChronoTrack hardware emits a high-pitched whine. Charter fishing boats with passengers prepare to depart. One boat captain's bushy white mustache and belly reminds me of a walrus. [Civil twilight begins brightening the sky from 5:41-6:09 a.m.](https://www.weather.gov/lmk/twilight-types), as I near Mile 3. We pass the 7-minute \"The Fitness Court\" public outdoor exercise gym. Someone appears to exit the herd and do pull-ups. 👀 WTF (probably not a race participant?!)\n\n## Miles 4-6 (Marina Green to Golden Gate Bridge approach)\n\nRun my best pace here, at 10:20. Sunrise at 6:10 a.m., as I near Mile 5--though the overcast sky mostly obscures it. A few runners publicly urinate along the side-trails & bushes. Mile 6 begins at the ocean, just before [Torpedo Wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_Wharf), where people fished & huddled next to their poles. I found this section refreshing: ocean waves lapping, the smell of the sea, and cool humid breeze. Arrr. 🏴‍☠️ Mile 6 runs right up to the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, then returns to Torpedo Wharf. This section has a bit of room for passing, but not much.\n\n## Miles 7-10 (Golden Gate Bridge - Northbound & Marin Headlands - 1st Half)\n\nMile 7 begins near the ascent to the Golden Gate Bridge roadway deck. I welcomed my interval walk breaks. My hill training did help here--I remember to increase turnover, lean forward a bit, do not over-strain the hamstrings, etc. But let's not kid ourselves--this segment sucks. In contrast: what a thrill to run on the Golden Gate Bridge 🌉💜 I miss running on the roadway itself. The sunrise briefly became indirectly visible--its rays passing through a gap between the bottom of the clouds and the top of the horizon--warmly illuminating and reflecting off the waves. Far below, birdlike specks skim the water. Vehicles honk their horns; runners wave in return. I never had an issue with over-hydration--if anything, I was possible under-hydrated. Mile 9 ends on a glorious downhill. I bombed down it. My quads (and my big toes in incorrectly-laced shoes) paid the price, but--at the time--it felt so worth it. Mile 10 continues the wonderful downhill, with two moderate hills in the middle. I ran my 2nd-best mile pace here: 10:24. This mile segment represents the north-most portion of the race, almost beginning the approach to Sausalito, but instead turning back at East Road.\n\n## Miles 11-15 (Marin Headlands - 2nd Half, Golden Gate Bridge - Southbound, Presidio)\n\nMile 11 was the last mile I consider reasonably near my goal pace, at 11:28 (-38 seconds). It was overwhelmingly downhill, but I was paying the price for going downhill too fast. I slowed down to rest the pain in my big toes 😝 Painful lesson. Running along Horseshoe Bay and seeing the Golden Gate Bridge took my breath away. 🌉 I think this may have represented the [Wear Blue Mile](https://www.wearblueruntoremember.org/), with roadside photo board displays of service members killed in action, and a group of people with American flags cheering at its conclusion. Mile 12 begins with the steep ascent to the southbound roadway deck of the Golden Gate Bridge. Organizers bill this as [the Garmin Hill Climb Challenge](https://www.thesfmarathon.com/garmin-golden-gate-challenge/): ascend 171 feet over a--congested--half-mile. I finished it in 7:22, mostly walking this segment along with nearly everyone else. Mile 13 goes up and over the Golden Gate Bridge: Iconic from this side too! Love the Marin Headlands 👀 Looking at northbound pedestrian sidewalk, I saw streams of 1st-Half marathon runners, who had staggered 7:00-7:22 a.m. starts from the Crissy Field Sports Basement. I started crossing the Golden Gate Bridge southbound at \\~7:40 a.m., so it's likely I was mainly watching roughly Mile 3 of the 1st-Half Marathon. Loved the refreshing cool and humid ocean air. I passed the halfway point: Mile 13.11 with an unofficial split per Garmin/Strava of 2:28:09, \\~8 minutes behind goal pace ✅ While crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, I also experienced the 1st (of a few) 1st-Half Marathon pace bicyclists aggressively verbally clearing a path for elite runners. The runners were amazing to watch as they glided by. Knowing they had not come as far does not diminish their pace. Humans are amazing. Mile 14: At the hydration tables, I took Nuun, water, and--for the first time--Chargel. Another calculated risk--continuously fueling was not something I had done enough thinking about. During my long runs, I stopped every 10 miles at home, or at convenience stores for hydration. I had neither option now, so out of necessity I started fueling with what I had. The Chargel was semi-liquid with what felt like boba drink jellies. It was easy to squeeze and consume. The energy surge did help. Mile 15 continues the extended downhill all the way to the end of the Presidio. How I wish I had had the toes & quads to bomb down this hill like I did in the Marin Headlands!\n\n## Miles 16-20 (Richmond District, Golden Gate Park, & Haight)\n\nThe uphill toward Golden Gate Park begins just before mile 16. Leaving the lush Presidio and entering residential areas with 2-3 story Victorians clearly signals the 2nd \"city\" half has begun. The 1st \"bridge\" half is now in the rear-view mirror. I listened to my audiobook. I vaguely remember hilly asphalt canyons rolling between buildings. Volunteers waved traffic through. One volunteer sang and danced in-place. Regrettably, as I reached Golden Gate Park my Skullcandy Sesh Evo earbuds reported \"battery low\". 😝 Turns out they have \\~3.0-3.5 hours battery life. They recharge quickly in the charging case (which I did during long run breaks at home), but I did not have it. My muscles felt sore, but not injured. I can work with that! Mile 17 started with the calming Rainbow Falls ☺️ This was uphill and my pace slowed, but as I made the conscious decision to slow, my mood continued to improve. I had determined to accept my cooked status and enjoy the race. Slow = good mood = want to run the race again ✅ On JFK Drive, I ran past public art displays and roadway painted art. At the end of Mile 17, at the corner of JFK Promenade & Blue Heron Lake Dr, I think this was where [one booster had a poster board with illustration \"Tap here to Power Up\"](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9-f2ILMXvq/)--he was really over-the-top and his friends cheered as people punched the sign. Mile 18 goes around Stow Lake. I barely remember it from 2006 (too tired!). This time, I slowed down and enjoyed it: ducks, paddle-boats, trees, etc. The asphalt path narrows, but stays flat. Another official race pace bicycle passed by, verbally telling runners & walkers to stay right and make way for 2nd-half marathon front-runners, who had staggered 8:30-8:46 a.m. starts from Murphy Windmill. This was [the 2nd-Half Marathon Mile #3-4](https://www.thesfmarathon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Second_Half.pdf). I also observed stampedes of runners passing by. I'm guessing these were respective staggered waves of 2nd-half marathoners going for time goals. This seemed irritating for both them and slower runners, as the latter drifted left instead of staying right. The 2nd-half marathoners zipped past at-speed, threading any available gaps, narrowly avoiding collisions. I stayed right and tried to respect them, but despite this a few risk-takers dashed around me on the right shoulder. 😛 Mile 19: Back on JFK Promenade. Pedestrians scramble to cross between runners. At some point around this time, I came up with a strategy: using my Garmin watch & heart-rate monitor, [I can observe and manage my heart-rate via three zones](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/forerunner225/EN-US/GUID-DA94D501-8DA7-46A4-93D4-34504337272C.html): 1) Blue (Easy: Comfortable pace; conversational); 2) Green (Aerobic: Moderate pace; optimal cardiovascular training); and 3) Orange (Threshold: Fast pace; forceful breathing). I decided to adapt my run/walk--running when blue (\\~125 bpm) and walking when orange (> 145 bpm, I think). My body did feel cooked, but I found myself relaxing, recovering, and enjoying the race more. Mile 20: I loved taking the time to go through the bohemian Haight: Jimi Hendrix mural, bookstores, coffee shops, etc.\n\n## Miles 21-25 (Haight-Ashbury & Subsequent Areas)\n\nJust 10K distance left 🙂 Mentally I have felt OK: I know I have trained and done the work, so just counting the miles as I slowly progress. I have done 10K. I can visualize the route I take near my house...but I also know how much time it takes. 😛 Mile 21 is nearly all downhill. More runner valves: race volunteers swing long banners in tandem across the intersection, shunting runners one way or another for traffic control. It feels just a bit disconcerting to get cut-off from the pack and shunted onto a deserted street, like I'm about to get whacked 😅 Once reaching the Mission District and beyond, my brain got bored. A volunteer in an inflatable T-Rex costume handed out cups at the Golden Gate Running Club aid station (Mile \\~21.5 near 229 Guerrero St in the Mission District) 🦖💯 Another unofficial aid station had people offering small homemade pancakes. Sadly, I observed one partially-eaten pancake discarded in the roadway just around the corner. Later, I overheard a male runner say to their female running partner: \"I think it might have been a mistake to start drinking this can of beer\"; they replied \"Why don't you just chuck it?\". Friends, he did NOT chuck the can of beer.🍺 I thanked an elderly Asian couple who were cheering-on runners--the connection I felt when I saw the way their faces lit-up at having someone say thank you back to them. 😊 I tried frequently to clap and also verbally thank boosters for taking the time and energy to pump us up. Near the end, I belatedly recognized how mind-numbing it must be for hydration volunteers to say \"electrolytes\" or \"water\" or whatever it is they provide, for hours at a time.\n\n## Finish\n\nThe SF Giants had opened their gates for the afternoon game against the Colorado Rockies, and I passed attendees queuing. Medics assisted someone on the ground onto a stretcher, shielding them from view with blue tarp 😥 The course ran around the stadium, with orange safety cones separating the raceway from attendees. Little acts of kindness: Near the end, one woman kindly stayed with her companion, encouraging her to go as slow as she needed to in order to finish. 💜 I think I timed my last running interval about as well as I could--I was able to run continuously and smile and enjoy the moment. Finished with a new PR for the SF Marathon, and my #2 marathon finish overall 💯 I felt much better than in 2006--afterward I had felt so exhausted I had to sit doubled-over in the nearby YMCA locker room before showering. As someone else mentioned, my post-race Garmin training readiness = 1 😅\n\n# Post-race\n\n## What worked:\n\n* Anti-chafing: legs & chest \n* Race prep: laying out everything the night before\n* Masking\n* Hotel & logistics\n* Audiobook\n* Weather: perfect\n* Magnesium lotion: relaxed slightly sore Achilles & muscles night before\n* On-pace 1st-half marathon (2:28:09), \\~8 minutes over target 2:20:00 time\n* Watch charged and only drained by about half\n\n## Improvements:\n\n* Charge phone to 100% night before\n* Train to properly target 10:50/mile race pace\n* Fuel for continuous marathon goal distance\n* Earbuds capable of 6-hour+ run time (or carry charging case, or bring spare pair)\n* Hill training\n* Protect toes on downhills: Heel-lock lacing, etc.\n* Move ahead in the Corral chutes\n* Pace: Determine how best to conserve energy on hilly courses (e.g., negative split)\n* Race my pace; the Full Marathon course overlaps with runners from the 1st- and 2nd-Half Marathons\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

        "Texto": "**IMAGE:** [**https://imgur.com/a/9fUYatv**](https://imgur.com/a/9fUYatv)\n\nNow I've tried a few different shoes throughout my running 'career', and would like to make a comment on each, to hopefully enlighten and help some of you to decide what shoe to get next!\n\n***Ill start from the top, and move downwards, as the shoes get newer (& and more expensive).***\n\n**1) Nike ZoomFly 3** - I want to start off by saying, that this shoe is super great! I bought it back in 2021 for around 120 dollars and ran primarily in this shoe until 2023, and was very happy with its performance. This was my first good running shoe, so I felt the difference instantly. I used this shoe for both training and races, getting my 5km PB @ 18:26. They worked great as a race shoe as well (Back then I didn't get to try any of Nike's top-tier race models, but these did just fine for me). From searching on the internet, it seems hard to get your hands on a new pair of these, since it's an older model, so I won't go much further in detail. I have run more than 600km in these shoes, and they still feel great, although I can definitely feel a difference from when they were brand new regarding the foam.\n\n**2) Nike ZoomFly 5** - I must say, that I was slightly disappointed with this shoe - as stated before, I was thrilled with my ZoomFly 3, but this shoe felt completely different. The ZoomFly 5 feels a lot more like a daily trailer (I know it is) compared to the ZoomFly 3. It feels heavier and simply more chunky. The upper is more padded, and it doesn't sit as tight, as the previous model. For a standard trainer, this shoe would do just fine, but I would not recommend this shoe if you're looking for a hybrid shoe, that you can both train and race in. On the other hand, they are very durable and will be able to run many kilometers (as a daily trainer should be able to).\n\n**3) Nike Alphafly 1** - My first initial thoughts on the Nike Alphafly 1's was Wow. It truly feels like you're walking on a cloud. Even though it's now 4 years since the release date, this shoe is not outdated by any means. The shoe is amazing. The upper feels great, it's easy to put on, and I experienced no heel slips, it feels very secure. This is by far the most bouncy shoe I have in my collection, and I like it - For me, it has a different feel than the Alphafly 3. The shoe feels fast, and easy to hold at a steady pace. I have yet to try these for longer distance running, but I have done a few fast 5k's in these, and even though I see people not recommending Alphafly's for shorter distances, I must say that I am very satisfied with these, and they are completely fine for shorters distances too (Same goes for every shoe in my collection IMO).\n\n**4) Nike Vaporfly 3** - I have no previous experience with Vaporflys, but I will say, that this shoe feels like an upgraded ZoomFly 3, but obviously, this has way better technology behind it. The way the shoe feels on foot is quite similar to the ZoomFly 3, and it works great! Sits very tight on your foot, with no heel slippage at all. This shoe feels very aggressive - with its 8mm stack difference, it really wants to push you forward. And with a weight of 152g(!!) EU 42, it feels so light on your foot. It is however not as bouncy as the Alphafly 1 & 3, but that is to be expected of course. In my opinion, this shoe feels faster on shorter distances, than both of the Alphafly's. However, I could definitely run a marathon in these, even though they don't have the same bounce as the Alphafly. I think it's hard to choose between either the Vaporfly or Alphafly, but if you prefer a bouncy shoe, I would go with the Alphafly''s.\n\n**5) Nike Aplhafly 3** - Nike's newest super-shoe! I picked it up recently to complete my collection. And I'm very happy with its performance, however, it is quite different from the Aplhafly 1! In my experience, the Aplhafly 3 feels like a mix of the Vaporfly 1 & the Alphafly 1. The Alphafly 3 has an aggressive stack height of 8mm (like the Vaporfly), combined with the Air Zoom Pods, which really works great in combination. They are however not as bouncy as the Aplhafly 1, but more bouncy than the Vaporfly 3 - But I feels more aggressive than the Alphafly 1 with the 8mm stack height. The upper of this shoe is upgraded from the Alphafly 1's, the 3's are very secure on your shoe, and it fits and feels super great! I'm very happy with the performance of this shoe so far, although I have yet to use it for longer distances. In my opinion, they work just fine for shorter distances like 5 & 10km's.\n\nIf you have any further questions regarding any of these shoes, I'm more than happy to answer.\n\nHappy running!"

My main training focus was introducing 70-80 mile weeks and back-to-back long runs. While I had previously experimented with two consecutive long runs every week, the combined mileage of the two runs never exceeded 35 miles, previously. In this case, I would max out my weekly mileage at 80 miles a week which included two consecutive day long runs totaling 44 miles. Additionally, two of my longest runs included a marathon on a track to prepare for the mental monotony of a flat course and completing a trail run on the 24-mile round trip Barr Trail to Pikes Peak.\n\n \n\n**Before the Race**\n\nA massive component of preparing for this race was planning the logistics surrounding the event. For starters, the crewing requirement was significant. Luckily, I have an amazing family that was willing to help. Additionally, given the nature of the event, most of the water, ice, and calorie supply was the responsibility of the runner. I spent several hours meticulously planning how many calories I would need and from what sources the calories would be best. I ended up relying solely on nutrition bars and a high-carbohydrate drink mix from Skratch Labs. I packed enough of the two products to supply roughly 10,000 Calories of energy. For clothing choices, I packed my Nike Zegama Trail Running shoes, Nike Pegasus Trail running shoes, and 2 running outfits to change into throughout the race. I also packed plenty of first aid supplies, night running lights, two trail running vests, running water bottles, sunscreen, bug spray, battery banks, chargers, Blistex Five-Star SPF Chapstick, and folding chairs.\n\nLiving only a few hours away, we drove down to Kingman County the day before the race and stayed at the Victorian Lantern B&B, which is the most beautifully renovated B&B I have ever stayed at. Originally built in 1887, the home was purchased by the current ownership in 2012 before undergoing 6 years of remodeling prior to opening its doors as a bed and breakfast. Aside from having a son under the age of 1 that kept us up for a portion of the night, I slept great! I woke up a little tired and grumpy, but ready to torture myself for the next 20 or so hours.\n\n \n\n**Miles 0-38**\n\nStarting in the northwest corner of Kingman County at Cheney Lake, the first 5 miles toured the west end of the lake before exiting the park and beginning a 38 mile path straight east. Even though this portion of the course was the most monotonous, time flew by, and I felt great. I clocked a 4-hour marathon in the first 26.2 miles. I had planned six crew checkpoints throughout the entire course, roughly 1 every 16 miles, but I had to add an additional water refill point around mile 30. This was the first of many unplanned crew checkpoints. Thankfully, my crew was flexible and happy to adjust. Overall, miles 0-38 of the race was relatively uneventful. My hydration and calorie consumption plans were going smoothly. By the time we finally turned south at mile 38, I was feeling great and briefly thought I could catch the leaders, who were 15-20 minutes ahead of me.\n\n**Miles 38-52**\n\nAs soon as I turned south, the northward 20 mile an hour winds began to take its toll. I had to stop for a quick bathroom break at mile 44, which offered temporary relief from the wind, but the beating resumed immediately afterwards. By the time I reached the end of the north-to-south portion of the course, my energy was low, my stomach was unhappy, the heat had climbed to the low 90’s, and it was only 2:30 pm in the afternoon. While the wind was no longer an opposing force, I knew I had to battle another 3 hours of intense heat.\n\n**Miles 52-80**\n\nAt mile 54, I had my third planned crew checkpoint to refill on water and food supplies. Once I stopped running, the minor nausea transformed into extreme lightheadedness, a total lack of appetite, and an intense doubt of my ability to finish. Instead of a planned, brief 5-minute stop, I hung around for 20 minutes, attempting to gather myself before continuing. I could tell that my crew noticed the change in attitude, but they encouraged me to continue onward and trust my training.\n\nMentally, I entered a dark space for the next 2 hours and had to battle for every mile. It’s funny how our memory blocks out the negative parts of the experience, because aside from the general memory of how difficult this portion of the race was, I do not remember much. Around mile 68, my mental state turned from negatively and doubt to gratitude for the experience, gratitude for my crew, and powerful waves of determination. As often happens in these types of races, this solitary realization was deeply emotional and one of the highlights of the experience.\n\n**Miles 80-94**\n\nWhile the change in mental state renewed my confidence in my ability to finish, every mile leading up to mile 80 was still a battle. At the mile 80 checkpoint, I took an extended 30-minute break to rest my legs and spend time with the group. This extended rest period let my legs recover significantly and allowed me to spend additional time with the crew before focusing in on the last few hours of the race. By this point, I was fully confident in my ability to finish. I intentionally kept my pace conservative and enjoyed the transition into night.\n\n**Miles 94-100 (108???)**\n\nBy mile 94, we were fully into nighttime and headed back north to the finish line. Doing some mental math, I realized that either the course had 8 “gift” miles, or my watch was off by the same amount. I was using the “Ultra Track” feature on my Garmin Fenix watch and figured that may affect the GPS accuracy (Overall, I was incredibly pleased with the performance of my watch. I was able to use it in Ultra Track mode for the entire 21 hours of the race, and it only used 50 percent of the battery). In either situation, the additional mileage, whether real or perceived by GPS error, was a tough mental hurdle to overcome.\n\nWhile I had only planned for a crew check once throughout the final portion of the race, we made the decision to increase the frequency to once every couple of miles. I had drastically underestimated how dangerous it can be on two lane county roads at night, and the crew agreed. This points to how important crewing is in events like these – having a group that is willing to adapt to the demands of the day is a gift. Multiple times throughout the last few miles, I was amazed by how willing everyone was to rise to the challenge to help me finish the event. The temperatures had dropped at this point, so I was able to increase my pace for the final 8-12 miles until I crossed the finish line at 3:15 am.\n\n \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nUltra marathons are wildly difficult. 100 milers are brutal. I focused nearly all my free time the last few months to prepare myself for this race in addition to multiple years of 50+ mile weeks, and I still physically felt underprepared. However, putting myself in a challenging physical situation was rewarding, and even more rewarding since I was able to power through the difficulty.\n\nUltra marathons are also far from an individual sport. 5ks, half marathons, and even marathons require limited support from additional people, and most of the support would occur during training. This race required a full team on race day to even give myself a chance at seeing the finish line. Now that it’s over, it’s time to rest, recoup, and adjust my long term personal goals and fitness goals."

I’ve seen a lot of people say otherwise, but tapering, gels, and even carbo loading do work for half marathons. Also, it is possible to set a PR in the SF half marathon.\n\nRace Info\n\nName: San Francisco Half Marathon\n\nDate: July 28th, 2024\n\nShoes: Alphafly 3\n\nGel: Gu energy gel (two total)\n\nHow far? 13.1 miles\n\nFinish time: 1:27:16\n\n\nGoal:\n\nA+: Finish in 1:26:00 - no\n\nA: 1:27 - yes\n\nA-: Finish under 1:30:00 - yes\n\nB: 1:30 to 1:35\n\nC: 1:35 to 1:40\n\nReport:\n\nI woke up about 5:10 and got right out of bed. I did some kettleball swings and burpees. I then had coffee and my typical breakfast (lavash, banana, some whey, honey, salt). I then did my warmup routine and we departed about 6:15 to the dropoff point.\n\nI lined up at the very front in corral A. I saw the 1:30:00 pacer and told myself to not let him pass me. I got a bit teary eyed during the pledge of allegiance at 6:59. I had trained for seven months. In January, my half marathon time was still over 1:50:00 and it was a bit emotional that maybe everything could now come to fruition. Also I connected this run to much more beyond myself so that it could have significance and meaning. \n\nThe race started right at 7:00. The first mile was flat and I felt surprised to be completely comfortable with the front five guys. My first mile was 5:58. At mile two the first climb started. I knew my pace going uphill, and it was not as fast as theirs. I was fine with that. I told myself that going uphill I would always stick to the pace I knew. This mile was 6:22 with a 79’ elevation gain. Mile three, coming to the bridge, was 7:25 with 140’. I must’ve sped up across the bridge because mile four was 5:44. The bridge is relatively flat. I was really afraid of a bottleneck at the bridge but there wasn’t one at all. My friends finished a bit over two hours and said they did experience a bottleneck.\n\nMiles 4-8 went through just south of Sausalito. There was a portion with photos of young soldiers who had died in WW2. That reminded me that I was doing this run for more than myself. At times when I felt pain I reminded myself of who I am running for and sped up. \n\nThe second half of this area had a huge downhill portion. I set my metronome to 220 and just did my best to fly down here. This strategy worked for me. Mile 6 was -156’ with a 5:55 pace.\n\nGoing back across the bridge there were a lot of marathon runners to weave through which was fine. There was a headwind heading back so I could use them to block the wind. Miles 10 to 11 were through Presidio, 11 to 12 through a neighborhood, and then 12 to 13 through Golden Gate to the finish line. The elevation was about 500’ under what’s posted online. In fact, it seemed more downhill than uphill. Also, the finish line was put about .1 miles too early. I kept running past it to record 13.1 because my goal was really important to me.\n\nThere was one specific runner I tried to stick to and he really helped me keep my pace. Going uphill he was a bit faster than me, downhill I was a bit faster, and on the flat portions we were about even.\n\nHere are other things that helped me reach my goal:\n\n•Giving my goals meaning and purpose. Whenever things got tough I reminded myself of my purpose.\n\n•The energy of the crowd.\n\n•Taper and a moderate carb load with low fat the week and especially the two days before.\n\n•No drinking for two weeks.\n\n•Writing down how the run would transpire before it happened and what my times would be at each mile - this was huge. I wrote down these things well before and the day transpired almost exactly as I had written. It’s almost freaky. Running is over 60% mental. We can create our reality simply from what we envision. Below are the times I wrote down I would hit and then my actual times.\n\nWhat I wrote down earlier in the week:\n- 2.5 to the bridge (2.5) - :16  \n- 1.5 across bridge (4) - :26  \n- 4 Sausalito (8) - :52 \n- 1 end of bridge (9) - :59\n- 2 Presidio (11) - 1:12\n- 1 streets (12) - 1:19\n- 1.1 Golden Gate Park (13.1) - 1:27\n\nActual\n0 to 2.5: 15:37\n0 to 4: 25:25\n0 to 8: 52:41\n0 to 9: 59:06\n0 to 11: 1:11:58\n0 to 12: 1:19:19\n0 to 13.1: 1:27:16\n",

The goals were: having a good time, improving on my 10K PB and if at all possible even go sub-45. Met the first two, and almost made the third as well!\n \n### Pre-race\nThe race takes place in a crowded shopping area, closed to street traffic of course for the event. Pretty good organization, lots of happy faces and a relatively low temperature for end of July (21 C) with clouds. At first I couldn't find a proper spot to warm-up, but then I noticed an area where lots of people were running in circles. After a bit of dynamic stretching I joined them for a first 1K warm-up jog, followed after a bit by about 5 minutes of sprints. Warming up with such a lot of other folks did wonders to put me in the mood for racing.\n\n### Race\nThe initial plan was to run the first 3K at about 4:45/km and see if I could keep that pace for the rest of the race or perhaps even ramp it up. That would have guaranteed a PB, and probably crossing the finish line without much pain. The nice conservative plan went out of the window at KM 1 due to race adrenaline and the fact that most people in my starting block (C) were starting faster than that. Slowed down slightly at the second KM to try and avoid spending all energies right away. At some point towards the first few kilometers it started drizzling, which felt pleasant given how hard my body was working. From KM 3 I had the feeling I could probably sustain the pace for the rest of the run and went for it. The rain increased and the street started feeling slightly slippery under my shoes, one person in front of me almost fell. That was a good reminder that among all other goals, not falling on my face should probably be number 1. All good till KM 8, when keeping in the 4:30s started feeling quite hard. The rain intensified further, and at this point it was fairly dark. Not great for my vision given that the glasses were all wet, but on the other hand it was good to remember that I just had to see a few meters ahead of my feet and opening the throttle for the last KM. My watch said 00:45:17, and I almost couldn't believe I took 3 minutes off my latest PB!\n\n### Post-race\nGot my medal, drank a few cups of water and ate two protein bars made available by the organizers. It was very hard, I was smiling soaked wet in a mixture of rain and sweat and slowly making my way to the metro. I feel good and it seems that my training is on the right track for the marathon.

        "Texto": "A hole on the top of my left shoe above where my big toe sits made me more conscious of what my toes are doing when I'm running. Apparently I was unknowingly flexing the toe upwards which I think has also contributed to other foot problems. \n\nFor the past few weeks I've been mindfully trying to \"grip\" my toes down with each step and I think (at least anecdotally) it has made a noticeable difference in having more control of how I run and the amount of discomfort and pain I feel after runs. This helps me more easily avoid heel striking. Previously having to think about how my foot was hitting the ground and control it just didn't click. But now that I'm focused on my toes, it all came together and I can more easily ensure I'm landing fore/mid foot.\n\nI originally put thought into it after watching a youtube video about running form, [https://youtu.be/mkVUS6m5Y8U?si=MZK9IhlFMucAtKEF&t=285](https://youtu.be/mkVUS6m5Y8U?si=MZK9IhlFMucAtKEF&t=285) where the hole on the top of the shoe was mentioned.\n\nThis little thing makes me so happy. I finally feel like I have better control of a situation that was previously miserable from time to time. For about a 4 month period starting Feb 2024 I was nursing an injury around/above my left ankle that would flare up after runs. I think it was caused by a combination of bad form, weakness in my calves and trying to too quickly move to a different running shoe (Altra with a lower heel drop and less cushioning). While the discomfort and pain still shows up occasionally, usually after long runs, it has become less painful. \n\nHope this helps someone.\n\n  \n"

I have previously spent a good bit of time here for work, so I was excited to check out the run club scene. The first club on the list was In the Loop Run Club, which meets at Road Map Brewing near the downtown area not too far from the San Antonio Riverwalk. The Riverwalk is arguably the biggest attraction of San Antonio which essentially is a walkable surface that lines the San Antonio River. Development of the riverwalk began in 1939 based on the architectural design of Robert H.H. Hugman. It has since evolved into a cultural center of the city, including pedestrian walkway/bikeway, multiple hotels, and a collection of restaurants and shops. My initial attraction to this club was the fact that the route was mainly on the riverwalk.\n\nI showed up a few minutes early to Road Map Brewing and quickly found a parking spot in the parking lot on the south east side of the brewery. Roughly 20 people had gathered on the outdoor patio adjacent to the brewery along with a OnCloud booth. A local running store had set up a shoe locker with different sizes of one of their newer OnCloud models, and most of the runners were able to try out the shoes to see how they fit. Additionally, the running store reps were hodling a raffle to give away a pair of shoes and a few other OnCloud goodies. I spoke with a small group of the club regulars before the group picture was taken. I found a few runners who were planning on running around 7:00/mile before we headed out on the run.\n\nThe route was pretty simple – head west towards the riverwalk, then north along the riverwalk until we hit the halfway point, then we ran back to the brewery. I extended the route a bit to hit 4 miles, but the main club route was 3.1 miles. The riverwalk wasn’t too busy, but even if it was, the walkable sections are wide enough to accommodate a large amount of people. As I mentioned earlier, the riverwalk is lined with hotels, restaurants, and shops, so the route has a good amount of shade in the mornings and the evenings. Given that it was mid-June and the temps were well into the 90’s, the additional shade is critical in making the route more tolerable. For those of you that aren’t familiar with central Texas summers, the temperatures may be high, but the humidity is what will get ya. Running in shade during the summer in Texas in a must.\n\nOnce we returned to the brewery, most people hung out and had a few beers. The running store reps did their raffle and gave away the prizes. I spoke with a few other runners before leaving. Several individuals also walked part of the route, which points to the inclusivity of the club. While some clubs are geared more towards runners only and no walkers, that was not the case for In the Loop run Club. Overall, the club definitely gave off a “tightly-knit” vibe, and it was clear that a good portion of the runners had frequented the club for quite some time. "

The plan was fairly standard - speed intervals, easy run, tempo run, long run - but quite low volume (I averaged 47km a week), and I will definitely look for a higher mileage plan for my next HM. With that in mind, I supplemented the plan with an extra run (hard 5k parkrun effort) most weeks and around 3 hours a week of cycling on the indoor trainer.\n\nI live in a hilly area and always struggled with pacing speed workouts because of that, so for this block I decided to make better use of my gym membership and do all the speed intervals on a treadmill. As much as I dislike running indoors (too hot, no breeze, and so boring!), it was definitely the right choice as I could dial in my pace for the intervals and just do the work.\n\nI was able to complete the training plan as-written almost exactly except for week 9, where I got sick and had to skip the longest run of the block (19km). It was unfortunate to miss that long run, but I added a little extra bike volume the following week to compensate, and had felt comfortable on the previous week's 17km run so I was confident in running the HM distance.\n\nDuring the build-up to the HM I did a 10K B race with a 4-minute PB at 44:15, and knocked over a minute off my 5K parkrun PB, getting it down to 20:47 a week before the race. Based on those results, I set my goal time around a 60% age grade (33M) to go sub 1:37, with a B goal of sub 1:40 and a C goal of PBing over my first HM (1:48).\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI arrived far too early (as I always seem to!) and got in a warmup jog around the area before heading to the start for my wave time. I had taken a tumble on my long run the previous weekend, leaving me with a bruised hip and knee (as well as a few patches of road rash), so I was keen to get those properly warmed up ahead of the race.\n\nDue to the width of the towpaths and the number of runners, the race was in time trial format with seeded waves of around 100 runners each. In true British summer fashion, the drizzle had already set in by time I arrived at the start, and it was a chilly few minutes stood waiting for my wave to set off. The race director advised us in the safety briefing of an on-the-day diversion which increased the final race distance by about 500m.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race route runs along the canal towpaths between Wolverhampton and Birmingham, on a mix of surfaces including gravel, cobbles, oncrete, brick and (thanks to the rain) plenty of mud. I immediately set off 5s/km too fast for my planned negative-split pacing, which I put down to a combination of race adrenaline and having to overtake traffic quickly on the narrow paths. The first 5km felt great, and after passing some runners early on I settled into a small group with a few guys who were, in their own words, \"running way too fast\". At around 6km they started slowing down, so I wished them luck for the rest of the race and pushed on with one other runner.\n\nThe Coseley tunnel is the longest tunnel on the route at 329m long, and although the race organisers had attached battery-powered lamps to the railings at intervals it was still very dark and almost impossible to see the cobbled surface ahead. Very keen not to repeat my rendezvous with the ground from the previous weekend, I ended up high-stepping my way through to avoid catching my feet on the uneven and slightly slippery surface. I'm sure I would have looked ridiculous, were it not too dark to see me! Despite the overcast skies and unrelenting rain, the daylight was almost blinding coming out of the tunnel, but I was just relieved to be out in the open again.\n\nFrom about 11km to 17km I was almost entirely on my own, having reached the gap between start waves, and I found it took a lot of concentration to stick to my goal pace (by then around 4:33/km) without anyone else around me for reference. The course diversion was also during this interval, taking us off the New\\* Main Line and onto the Old Main Line which runs for a stretch under the M5 motorway flyover. This was also by far the most challenging part of the course in terms of terrain, taking in some short but steep slopes up and down the embankment between the canals, and also involving the muddiest stretch of the path. I was wearing road shoes (Hoka Mach 6) which provided very little in the way of grip on the mud, and I expended a lot more energy than I had planned in trying to keep the pace up while staying upright.\n\nFor the final 5km I had caught up to some runners from an earlier wave, which was a huge mental boost after nearly half an hour alone. I was starting to feel the miles in my legs, particularly my injured hip and knee, and although I was exactly on my target average pace of 4:35/km it was becoming harder to keep up. The route up until this point had been very industrial, but moving further into Birmingham the paths became more well-maintained and the surrounding buildings changing from factories and warehouses to newly-built waterfront residential blocks, as part of the city's ongoing regeneration work around the canals\\*\\*.\n\nBy the last 2km, my too-fast start and the extra energy spent negotiating the muddy terrain (and probably the low training volume) finally came home to roost, and my pace dropped from 4:30 in km 19, to 4:35 in km 20, to 4:46 in km 21. I was watching the time and distance on my watch, and I knew I wouldn't make sub 1:37 for the full (extended) race distance, but I hoped it was still within reach for the standard HM distance. I gave it one last push for the last few hundred metres into 21.1km, and crossed the virtual \"line\" in 1:36:57! After that, I kept up as much pace as I could muster for the remaining 0.5km and crossed the real line in 1:39:xx.\n\n\\*The New Main Line was opened in 1838, so not all that new nowadays, but still not as old as the Old Main Line which was operational in 1769.\n\n\\*\\*Fun fact, Birmingham has more miles of canals than Venice!\n\n# Post-race\n\nAt the finish I picked up my medal and goody bag (water, t-shirt, snacks, and a souvenir [stick of rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(confectionery))), got slightly lost on the walk (or rather, hobble) to the station, and took the train back to Wolverhampton where I had left my car.\n\nOverall I placed in the top 100 (out of 1137 runners) and top 30 in my age group (out of 220), which I'm very pleased with for my second-ever HM. I had a great time, really enjoyed the point-to-point format (feels pretty cool knowing I ran from one city to another!), and came away with a solid PB in the half marathon.\n\nTo anyone who made it to the end, thanks for reading!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

        "Texto": "So a few quick throughs on the new Saucony Hurricane after a 10k run at a slow pace,\n\nFit -  first off, the shoe is big, but doesn't run like it. And certainly doesn't feel as heavy as it is. The fit is super comfortable but holds your foot in all the right places, I have a wide foot and fits me very well. It's super comfortable upper that will suit most feet. Fits true to size. \n\nMidsole- I'm 91kg runner, so a heavy runner. The step in comfort is unlike anything I ever tried, super plush and soft, but not mushy like Asics nimbus 26. I usually run in Novablast 4 or Saucony triumph 21, and the midsole, is very different from both. Triumph is a lot more dense and energy returning, similar to Novablast which is slightly bit softer. The Saucony hurricane 24 uses pwrrun pb, but again it's a different pb from endorphin series, it's a bit more dense and bit less energy returning. However it gives you a nice relaxed pop and energy return, at the same time it's soft and comfortable, you can definitely run long distances in it.\nProbably the most comfortable midsole I ever ran in for slow relaxed runs. \n\nThis shoe is definitely very well suited for heavy runners, the midsole doesn't bottom outand has a nice energy return, and is a bit more dense and firm than for example 1080 v13 or Asics nimbus, that feel very unstable and mushy. \n\nStability - this is a 10/10. Non intrusive stability elements that will fit most runners, it's wide but well structured where it doesn't feel overly bulky, even tho it looks like it. The stability is amazing especially when your feet get tired over longer runs. Very stable but with a nice rocker that will propel you forward. I'm a natural runner but for my weight I feel more comfortable in shoes with bit more stability and density in the midsole. \n\nOutsole - typical Saucony I would say, grips very well, all tho I ran in dry conditions, and will probably outlast most other shoes. \n\nFinal thoughts, I was a bit sceptical when I saw the size of the Shoe, I was expecting a Hoka Bondi 8, but it's a nice and smooth ride with good amount of energy return. A 10/10 shoe for tired legs, the stability elements come mostly from the bottom thin layer of pwrrun and denser version of pwrrun PB, and the width of the shoe. All tho it doesn't feel and run as bulky as it looks. \n\nIn advance I apologize for any spelling errors, I'm not a native English speaker.\n\nI will post some updates after few more runs.\n\n "

After all, what else is Boston known for besides high costs of living, Davis Clarke, abrasive residents, and running? I've run casually through high school and undergrad, mainly inspired by my dad. He initally encouraged me to take it up to help work on my poor cardiovascular health, but it turned out to be an on-and-off hobby I ended up enjoying every now and then. My dad has been my coach and mentor through all these years, and I've been really lucky to have someone like him to talk to about running and help me. After getting serious about working out and running in Boston, my dad and I had planned to run our local Turkey Trot last year, but those plans ended up falling through. I kept running, though, because at this point it just felt like it was fun. I got to the point at which I was proudly eating 5Ks for breakfast.\n\nCome marathon weekend, the city is buzzing with runners of all levels excited for the race. The energy was palpable, and I decided to call my dad and ask if we could try running together again. I looked for 5Ks in the Boston area, but my dad issued me a challenge: the only way he would fly out to Boston is if we did at least a 10K together. So imagine my surprise when I find out that registration for the Boston 10K is open, and the race falls on the exact weekend my mom was planning on being in town anyway!\n\nInspired by him and my neighbor, my dad and I signed up together and came up with training plans. My dad broke out his old marathon training plan spreadsheet, scheduling his runs with an almost psychopathic level of organization and encouraging me to do the same. In stark contrast with my dad's advice, my training plan was much less Excel sheet and much more I-queue-up-songs-on-Spotify-and-run-on-vibes-and-prayers. However, in general, I did one speed workout, one easy run, and one long run each week. Each of these were super unstructured; I focused much more on making the distance I had set out to do than pace or anything else like that. I also wanted to make sure I could regulate my heart rate for long enough to finish my run. Later on, I ended up skipping speed workouts for more easy runs (not the best call, I know), but I still tried to pace-regulate in a way that pushed my pace up.\n\nI began to learn a lot of small things that helped me a lot with my run as I started formally training for the 10K: drink water the night before, drink water before the run, and drink water after; finish your runs at the MIT Banana Lounge for a free post-run banana; pace regulation at the very beginning is important; wave and make conversation with the geese on the Esplanade to make sure you're still able to breathe. I actually ended up hitting the 10K distance relatively early, about 4 or 5 weeks into my training plan. I was pretty happy about this, and spent the rest of my time focusing on making these distances more manageable.\n\nBarring a couple exceptions for trips out of town, I stuck to my training schedule pretty well, logging consistent runs on Strava. By race day, I had already touched 10K thrice, so I was decently confident that barring extenuating circumstances, I'd *probably* be able to finish.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe week leading up to the race was dominated by a heatwave. The Texas boy in me thought it'd be a good idea to brave the heat, and boy was he wrong. My confidence was chipped away by my poor performance on a couple shorter runs (5K and 7K) I did in the week leading up to the race. Nerves were uncharacteristically high leading up to the race, but my family flying in definitely helped me quite a bit.\n\nThe night before the race, I had taken my family out to a nice dinner with some cousins of mine who lived in the area. After a delicious, albeit out-of-season, butternut squash gnocchi, we headed back to my place. My parents continued to cut it up with my cousins, at which point I decided to eat a Fiber One bar and call it an early night. The next morning, I woke up at 5:30. My dad was already out of the shower and ready to go. After an all-too-common fiasco with our T train breaking down, we Ubered to Boston Common, where we picked up our shirt (the true prize from this experience), took one last bathroom break, and lined up in the corrals in preparation for the clock to strike 8 AM. Like Cinderella, the O.G. distance runner, the moment the clock struck the hour, we were ready to run. \n\nSomehow, the exact moment the pros started, rain started absolutely POURING down on us in the corrals. It eventually abated by the time we actually started, but I ended up with my entire body soaked throughout the race. Not that I'm complaining though; it ended up cooling me down pretty well for the duration of the run.\n\n# Race\n\n*Mile 1*: High of the restlessness of waiting in line for fifteen minutes in pouring rain, the second wave got moving. Sopping wet, we crossed the start line, and after about 30 seconds... my shoes came untied. A phenomenal start. After a quick double-knot, I got back up and pushed through the crowds in Beacon Hill as we hit the Longfellow Bridge. I kept my pace slow, because I wanted to focus on negative splitting rather than running out of steam really early. Looking back, I think I was pretty successful at this, but I definitely felt weird at the time getting overtaken so often in the first mile. That's probably why my pace was slightly faster than I had intended at the beginning. Once we hit Memorial Drive and started running along MIT campus, I kinda began to zone out, and just kept going until the Mile 1 mark.\n\n*Mile 2*: Mile 2 started a bit slow; my dad and I were kinda silent at this point, as we had zoned out. The difference in speed between my dad and I became pretty apparent during this mile, to the point at which I told him to run at his own pace and leave me behind, an offer he refused (thanks dad :') ). It's a shame that we chose this segment of the race to zone out, because this was one of the most scenic (in my opinion) parts of the race, barring the Boston skyline from the Longfellow Bridge on mile 1. MIT's great dome to the right and the Charles to the left, you couldn't really ask for more. However, this segment did have a ton of spectators. Plenty of \"Go X Person\" and \"Run If You Think I'm Hot\" to go around. I did have a couple friends who showed up during this segment with a poster screaming their heads off when they saw me. Honestly, it gave me a much-needed boost to my feet and to my spirits.\n\n*Mile 3*: For me, this was probably the hardest mile. Not only had the faster runners hit the turn already, but this was probably the hilliest portion of the race. Thus, the combination of psychologically discouraging out-and-back segments plus the physical strain brought by the hills led to my slowest split yet. Worst of all, the Memorial Drive overpass was slick in the rain, causing my feet to slip with each step. However, I did have a few small things that kept me grounded during this mile. The sheer number of people I was dodging began to stress me out, so even if it wasn't technically allowed, running along the sidewalk by the road kept me sane. After that, a well-timed BAA DJ bumping \"Who Let the Dogs Out\" kept me going until the turnaround. \n\n*Mile 4*: Just as we hit the turnaround after Mile 3, I blew a quick kiss to the Trader Joe's that had fed me well in preparation for this race. After the turnaround, things got much easier; suddenly I was on the back stretch of Memorial Drive heading to the Harvard Bridge. The overpass was still slippery, but the slope was much gentler, so I could control my speed much better. The last segment of this mile was markedly easier after the BU Bridge, with me being able to finally keep pace with my dad. \n\n*Mile 5*: Hitting Mile 5 was rather uneventful, but I was beginning to speed up. My dad and I got cups of Gatorade, of which my shirt drank the lion's share. Coming back around the turn onto the Harvard Bridge, my friends found me once more and screamed loud enough to wake up the greater Boston area. This gave me just the push I needed to get further down Massachusetts Avenue. Mass Ave was rather uneventful, but my dad and I could banter down this stretch, which was a good sign. The sight of the Boston skyscrapers enveloped in fog finally helped me recontextualize where I was, pushing me even further down the Harvard Bridge towards Newbury. Generally, the course is downhill from here, and this worked beautifully to my advantage.\n\n*Mile 6*: My dad and I took our turn down Newbury with a good amount of speed, fully in banter mode. Post-run shopping plans were in full swing, and the jokes being thrown around gave us both confidence to hit a faster pace. Newbury was fully green, which, on an overcast Sunday morning at 9 AM, was the closest thing to heaven we could get. Hanging a quick right-left turn onto Boylston, we saw another cluster of spectators with posters. Shoutout to the lady with the \"Hurry up, you're making us late for brunch\" poster, I hope we didn't make you wait too long.\n\n*Mile 6.22*: Once we saw the 6 mile marker in the distance, my dad and I hit a full sprint. We wanted to empty the tank as much as possible. It was at this point I had breezed past my mom and sister, who were waiting by the Public Garden. My dad and I sprinted down the final stretch, and after hitting the finish and stopping my workout on my Apple Watch, I went fully nonverbal.\n\n# Post-race\n\nThe crowds at the finish were a little disorienting, but I ended up getting what I needed somehow in increasing order of importance; a water bottle, a goodie bag of snacks, a banana (that, I kid you not, I scarfed down with my bare hands, peel be damned), and my very own unicorn medal! I met back up with my friends who were spectating, my mom, and my sister, and we had a quick celebration + photo op. Surprisingly, after a quick couple stretches in the Common after the race, I wasn't particularly sore. \n\nI was on such a high later that day though that I ended up dragging my entire family around Boston and Cambridge, giving them a walking tour of Harvard Square and dragging them with me to the North End in the humid Boston heat for a cappuccino and a tiramisu, and leaving me with an absolutely ear-splitting headache. That night, my dad and I slept for 12 hours.\n\nI thought this race would finally give me some sort of closure on my training, but in fact it's done the exact opposite; I wanna keep going! Performance-wise, I think this race told me two things: 1) I think I can pace myself better, seeing as I was getting shorter splits as the race went on, and 2) maybe I can take on longer distances. My partner caught the running bug too, so we're probably going to train together for a half marathon come November. My dad said he'd also fly out for my half and run it with me, so that'll be an amazing experience too.\n\nAll in all, I loved this. I want to race more! If anyone has half training tips or general things I can do better when training, please let me know -- I'd love tips before I take on my first half marathon!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

Around January my sister asked if I would run a half marathon with her, and I reluctantly agreed. I hate running during the winter, and my spouse and I were trying to get pregnant. I figured I could always bail on the race if the training was too much for pregnant me, but that in the meantime the exercise would only benefit me.\n\nI found out I was pregnant the first week of March. I was thrilled! I was also right at the beginning of Hal Hidgons Novice 2 plan, but I felt fine the first couple weeks of pregnancy, so I muddled my way forward. Then morning sickness hit me like a truck. It was an all-day affair, with the kind of exhaustion the left me debilitated. However, I have a toddler already and there is no rest for the weary... or parents. Despite feeling like garbage, I put him in the stroller and ran 3 times a week. The cold and exercise actually helped the nausea during the activity and for about an hour afterwards. Somehow I pushed through until I hit my 12 weeks pregnant mark, which was about 8 weeks out from the half and when long runs were getting a bit longer.\n\nTraining went great until about 3 weeks before the race, we got hit with a heat wave that knocked me on my ass. I missed most of my runs during that time, because I could not cope with the heat and was more than a little nervous for my safety and the safety of the baby. I had a 10 mile run under my belt that had gone amazing, so I felt confident that I would be able to complete the half if the temperatures allowed.\n\nI want to note that I trained and took part in the race with my medical team's full approval. We discussed it at every visit, and they gave me the full go-ahead.\n\n\n### Pre-race\nThe nerves hit hard for the three days leading up to the race. The heat was still in the 90s and I was mentally panicking from all of my missed training. I barely slept the night before, and woke up around 4:30am to get ready to drive the 1.5 to Ithaca. I had an iced coffee and a bagel before leaving my house, and sipped water and had a nut bar on the drive down. The forecast was a high of mid 80s and overcast, with high humidity. Not ideal, but I could cope because of the lovely cloud coverage. \n\nWe shuttled to the starting line and checked in to get our bibs. This process was seemless. Lines for the bathrooms were only about a 5 minutes wait. The ceowd was eager and cheerful, and I felt encouraged being surrounded by the other runners, my sister, and her friend who joined us. The starting line was in a residential part of town, and it was quite beautiful and quaint. I did feel bad with how many people were crowding into people's yards while waiting for the start, despite organizers asking folks to respect the neighborhood.\n\n\n### Race\nWe took off during the center of town and immediately went up one of the only two steep inclines. We immediately got a longer downhill before the second incline, which was twice and long. There were some people out cheering, and I was very grateful to see anyone since this was mostly a rural route.\n \nMiles 1-4 still felt like I was mentally panicking, nerves getting the best of me. My bodu was feeling fine, but for some reason the angle of the roads were killing my feet. I got separated from my sister somewhere between 3 and 4, and she never quite caught up to me.\n\nMile 4 is where we left roads and headed on the the hard packed Black Diamond trail that goes through Taughanock Falls Park. It was 100% shaded and the surface made a big difference for my feet. Mile 4 had an aid station where i drank water and took my first maple syrup packet (I only trained using maple syrup as fuels, the other gels scare me haha). Mentally I felt like I was starting to calm down.\n\nMiles 5-8 came and went. I started needing to pee, but there was a line for the portapotty at mile 7 so I just kept going. The humidity meant I was soaked with sweat, even in my shoes. The only time I get blisters is when this happens, and I could feel them forming between my toes. Every step was becoming painful, and it was jarring me out of focus. \n\nI took my next maple syrup packet and found an open portapotty around mile 9. One of my greatest obstacles of the race was getting my sweat soaked bike shorts back up over my hips and baby bump. For a minute I thought I was going to get stuck half dressed in a portapotty in the woods. Miracles must be real, because with a huge pull and a lot of ungraceful wiggling, I got that spandex up where it needed to be and began running again. \n\n9-11 I did a few short walk breaks. I had stopped looking at my tracker and lost sight of the pace I was running as well, which is what I believe cost me my sub 2:20 goal. When I saw that Mile 11 marker, its like my mind finally got it together and I got on pace, my form improved, and I began cruising (albeit in a painful, exhausted way). I had planned on taking more fuel, but I felt very hot and full and I just couldn't stomach the idea of it. During this last stretch, I passed a couple of runners who were in tears and my heart went out to them. I said what I could while passing them; the conditions were a lot more draining than I think a lot of people were prepared for (myself included).\n\nI rounded the bend and saw the finish line across the river, all that was in my way was a short ramp up and over the bridge. When I tell you I thought that ramp might kill me... I gave myself more mental pep talking during the 15 seconds I ran up that ramp than any other part of the race. I crossed the finish line and all I cared about was finding some water. I still under my sub 2:30 goal, so I was happy about that.\n\nI saw a couple of runners getting medical attention from heat and exhaustion. I was thankful that I was still upright and feeling well, all things considered. My and baby's safety were the most important thing to me.\n\n\n### Post-race\nThe space where the race let out was very small and overcowded. It was hard to navigate the vendors tents and other racers and their families while stepping through flowerbeds. I found out later a lot of people never got their post-race meal, and I wonder if a factor was that they could push their way back to the food tent. \n\nI felt pretty good, just the usual amount of sore and tired. I had some post race food (a pork taco, fruit, yogurt), a popsicle, and a ton of water. We also stopped at a place called Chatty Cathys in Ithaca for a smoothie, so shoutout to them! By the time I had driven the 1.5 hours home, I felt a lot less fine. I had gone from sore to pure pain from the waist down. I had a raging headache. I ate more food, drank more water, showered, used a massage gun on my legs, took Tylenol for my head, and took a nap. I still felt pretty awful when I woke up, and I started to worry that my headache was from a spike in my blood pressure. I kept pushing as many fluids as I could and went to bed early.\n\nFirst thing the next morning was an appointment with my OBGYN (scheduled ahead of time). I had them check my BP right away, and it was normal. I had an ultrasound that showed a healthy and very wiggly baby! I can feel them kicking me as I write this. My OB agreed that the headache was most likely from dehydration and general depletion from the event, and to keep pushing fluids and electrolytes. It took another 24 hours for headache to ease up and for me feel like I'd finally made prgress in rehydrating myself. Today I'm feeling much better, still a little tired in my legs. Mentally, I feel very motivated to keep training distance and speed, but I know that it is time for me to start easing up on the intensity. My bump is finally making itself known and I'm feeling the pressure of high impact running in my pelvic floor. I do plan to keep running for awhile yet, but mostly for enjoyment and comfortable pacing. \n\n\nTL;DR:\nRan a half marathon while 20 weeks pregnant. It was hot and humid, and I suffered from some dehydration afterwards. I wish my pacing had been more consistent during the race, but overall I'm most happy with a safe and healthy finish!\n\n\nP.S.\nSomeone was littering their Gu packets along the route (I'm pretty confident it was one person because they were all the same flavor). Whoever you were, shame on you. Thank you to the wonderful racers I saw picking up someone else's trash and respecting the nature we were lucky enough to run through."

I’m on a delayed flight and have nothing but time… so skip to the end if you’re not in for a novel.\n\nI (40M, 175#) have been running for about 15 years. Started at 25 when I hated my job and promised myself I wouldn’t have to look at my blackberry until I left for work if I went for a run in the morning. It worked. Got hooked. Casual running with the occasional race for the next 5-7 years. Progressed through some 10Ks, a half marathon. Got hooked on trail running and pursued that for a while, culminating in a trail 20-miler the year my oldest was born. Stayed pretty into running until the pandemic hit. When everyone else was taking up running, I shifted to strength training and trying to exorcise the demons on a broken exercise bike I’d picked up for free. It just seemed like too much to get out the door and leave my wife with the kids.\n\nFast forward two or three years, and I restarted running at some point during 2022. I just wasn’t getting enough out of my routine and I (frankly) needed the calorie burn that only running can provide for me. As I approached 40 the waist line was NOT headed in the right direction.\n\nMy goal in restarting running was to ease in, keep up my strength training and not get injured. Over the next two years, I integrated running into my routine, sticking with three or four days of running max, and averaging about 15-20 miles per week around my (very hilly) neighborhood.\n\nThat period coincided with starting to take my diet seriously for the first time in my life. At the beginning of 2023 I was at a high of 205 (or maybe more…I rarely looked at the scale) at 5’10”. Change was needed!\n\nAbout a year ago I signed up for the Running of the Bulls 8K (a local institution run by the best race directors I know). I’d run it a bunch pre-pandemic, and I randomly did it 2021 after not running much at all the previous year. In 2023 I didn’t really train for it other than just running. But I surprised myself when I beat my 2021 time (48:48) by ten minutes (38:45). I thought, woah, maybe I should get more serious about this.\n\nThe summer of 2023 I started working with a coach for the first time, and training for real. I prepared for and PR’d in the Richmond Half (1:37:31) in November 2023. PR’d in the 5K (20:33) a few weeks later. Bit of a reduction through the holidays as I contemplated finally biting the bullet and doing a full marathon. I’d always said it wasn’t that interesting for me, but with the amount of great content out there I’d been watching and the incredible progress my running had made over the previous year, I thought…why not?\n\nThen, February 2024 was a plague month. I got COVID, the Flu and a sinus infection all in the space of four weeks. So we didn’t decide to pull the trigger until early March. Grandma’s was the latest “spring” marathon out there. Found a charity entry and was able to sign up. Let’s do this thing.\n\n# Training\n\nTraining was pretty solid for a first marathon build. I mostly cut out drinking (all but one day a week) and focused on fueling well. Before the block, I had been maintaining a base of around 25-30 miles per week. I was relatively injury free (if you don’t count the every-once-in-a-while calf cramping that would take me out for nearly a week while it relaxed…this would come back to haunt me).\n\nMy coach (you rock, Lindsey!) and I had set the goal of 3:30 based on my performances in the fall. I entered the training block feeling significantly less fit than I was in the fall. We gradually ramped up mileage and shifted our speed work focus toward the marathon. I kept up strength training 2-3 days per week and averaged 5 days per week of running. Weekly mileage ranged from 30 to three weeks over 50 miles.\n\nI have to say I loved marathon training (more than racing a marathon, at least—that hurt!). I didn’t feel as fit as I did half marathon training last summer, but I did feel like I was making steady progress.\n\nWe saved much of the marathon pace effort for the last six weeks of the training block. So I spent a lot of the block wondering whether the race pace was even realistic. I just didn’t know. A piss-poor April 5K didn’t help my confidence. And Garmin really didn’t help, as it consistently estimated my marathon time at 3:43-3:48 throughout the block.\n\nI also experienced some pretty debilitating calf cramping twice during the block. We isolated it to weakness in my posterior tibialis muscles and I worked with my awesome PT (shout out to Mollie at Peak Rehab in Durham) to rehab both times (it happened once in each leg). Picture me, wailing like a baby while getting dry needled in my calf and hobbling home after. Any tips on preventing this and REALLY strengthening the calf?\n\nPeak week came just two weeks after the last calf issue. I sailed through that. Best workout I had in the block was 18 with 3x3 miles at MP with 1 mile float. It felt GREAT. That was when I started to feel more confident.\n\nTaper went OK, though I definitely experienced the taper-related aches and pains that everyone talks about. Not as fun and light as I’d hoped!\n\nCarb loading was a whole other kettle of (Swedish) fish. I used the Featherstone Nutrition calculator which set me at a goal of 630 grams of carbs per day for three days. Y’all. That’s A LOT of carbs. I normally eat pretty clean so this was actually a challenge.\n\nFirst day was fine, just short of the goal. Second day was a travel day and it was a struggle to get enough. Experienced some gas that sucked and it was a slog. Third day (Friday) was another travel day as I headed up from Minneapolis to Duluth and it SUCKED. I felt so bloated and un-hungry it was a struggle to get the carbs. Lots of Gatorade and junk food just to make the number. Had a good dinner at a Duluth Japanese place of rice, tempura and a salad. NA beer to round out the carby dinner. Ended the night with some heartburn and a general feeling of “why did I do this to myself?” But I got pretty close to my carb goal.\n\n# Pre-Race\n\nI’d flown to Minneapolis on Thursday and hung out with some dear friends overnight. Friday I had a meeting mid-day and drove up to Duluth after. Long drive (lots of slowdowns), but I got to packet pickup, checked out the expo, had some dinner in town and headed north from my hotel after stopping for supplies at the co-op.\n\nMy hotel was FAR (about 15 minutes past the start in Two Harbors). I got up early on race morning. Coffee and I scarfed a bagel. Foam rolled and got dressed. Drove to the new (highly recommended) bus pickup at Two Harbors high school and got on the bus. My race plan included eating a banana or stroopwaffel on the bus. I regretted the banana I ate almost immediately (more to come on this).\n\nI got to the start area early (about 6:40) and chilled on my trash bag in the grass. It was cold and I had a long time to wait, so I just hung out, bundled up and chatted with my family at home on the phone. About 7:05 I decided I should use the bathroom one more time. The lines were INSANE. They said they’d had the biggest attendance ever…and you could tell by the lines. Waited. Waited. Waited. Downed my pre-race gel (a Maurten 100).\n\nAfter 30 minutes in line they announced the assistive division start. I still had 10 people in front of me and I hadn’t put on my shoes (which I’d left with my drop bag on the grass like an idiot). Then they announced the elite fields start. Then FINALLY got into the port-a-potty and peed. RAN back to my area, threw on my gear and packed up my drop bag. Then I ran over to the drop-off to ditch the drop bag. Trotted over to the race feeling anxious and like I’d screwed up my prep. Oh well.\n\nThe gun goes off as I’m still outside the corral and I use a side entry between A and B to join the flow of people just around where my intended start would have been (was aiming to start with the 3:40 pacers). Crossed the line and we were off.\n\n# Race\n\nThe heartburn I’d been experiencing the last 24 hours got worse almost immediately. I spent the first 10K with a bunch of diaphragm cramps and a generally bilious stomach. It wasn’t a fun way to start and my stomach stayed in the background almost throughout the whole race. I’d set a timer on my watch every 30 minutes and did a total of 6 during-race gels (4x regular Maurten 100 and 2x Caf). I was steadily hydrating with the handheld I brought (though I couldn’t stomach the LMNT I’d planned on so that was just water). I was happy I’d picked Maurten since they give me the least heartburn of any gel).\n\nMy plan was to ease into my first few miles around 8:20-8:10 and then gradually work down to goal pace (8:00) toward the half. The splits show I wasn’t really able to do this. I was just above goal pace for the first 8 miles. By 10K my stomach had settled a bit, the cramps weren’t so bad and I was in a rhythm. Feeling good-ish. Effort was hard-but-sustainable. I’m not sure how much these early miles cost me later given my other issues yesterday.\n\nMile 9 came with an unexpected bang. I have never had IT-band related knee pain. But there it was, stabbing right in the outside of my right knee. Had to stop twice to try to massage and stretch. Didn’t really help, so I modified my stride a bit and slowed to 8:10-8:15 pace. At this point I decided to screw the tangents and avoid the camber as much as possible since it seemed to be contributing to my knee issue. By 11 the issue went away (miracle!) and I was back in business.\n\nCrossed the half at race pace in 1:46 and started my next phase of my plan. Ditched my handheld and I started to work down below race pace. Miles 13-19 had some hills so I focused on relative effort and most of them clicked off under 8:00. Still taking water each aid station and staying with my gels every 30 minutes. I was feeling good and like my goal might possibly be in reach.\n\nBy mile 19 though, I could feel the mental effort to maintain pace building. I knew I was hitting the wall. I was still running but I couldn’t stay on pace. Miles 20-23 were a struggle. I started walking through the aid stations to give my body a break. Worst mile was 22, which I split in 9:23. By 23 I only had three and a bit to go, so I told myself to suck it up and start running harder. Could feel a calf cramp building through this section (it thankfully stayed away) and I gradually was able to work back down to an 8:34 in the last full mile. That one wasn’t pretty (helloooo headwind!), but I was able to “sprint” the last 500 meters and crossed the line in 3:37:33 (official, chip).\n\nI knew that 3:30 was pretty unlikely (first marathon, didn’t feel super confident in that pace), but I was feeling like it was still possible (and that 3:35 was achievable) all the way through mile 18. Once I hit that wall, I knew if I kept running I could make 3:40 or better.\n\nIf I hadn’t hit the wall (more mileage in training, better fueling, less annoying carb load?), I think sub-3:35 was in the cards yesterday, but it just didn’t come together.  Very happy that my calf held up throughout the race. Overall I’m thrilled with this as a first marathon.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI crossed the line, got my mylar blanket (good call), t-shirt and medal. A really nice fellow marathoner took a pic of me right after crossing (Thanks whoever you are!). Then I got in line for the bag check. It was HUGE. Took 20 minutes to get into the bag check area, then you had to fight to get in the scrum that was in front of your numbered table.\n\nGot colder and colder during that wait. At one point my neighbor asked if I was OK. I was sorta OK still. But by the time I had my bag in hand, I was full-on-teeth-chattering-shivering-cold. All that standing had also resulted in my right calf locking up and my IT band knee pain stabbing me every time I moved.\n\nIt was a long walk back to the busses, so when I saw an office building porch with a roof I headed there to change. Thankfully there was someone in the lobby changing and they let me in. HEAT! I thawed out a bit, put on dry clothes and got warm before venturing back out into the cold.\n\nHobbled the half mile back to the busses and waited a few minutes for the (yay coach) bus back to Two Harbors. Slept a bit on the bus in between texting with friends and family. Finally got back to my car. Walking was VERY painful. Drove into Two Harbors and stopped at Judy’s Cafe for a late breakfast (highly recommend). I was the only idiot in there with a marathon medal and mismatched sweats, but I felt right at home. Crushed eggs, sausage and excellent hash browns before heading back to my hotel.\n\nSpent the afternoon recuperating in my log-cabin-themed honeymoon suite (complete with handy whirlpool tub) overlooking Lake Superior. Hard-earned Swedish meatballs, salad and a beer for dinner in the hotel restaurant.\n\nLong drive back from up north this morning and I’m headed back to RDU now. 9/10 recommend. -1 point for long lines before and after the run.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nFirst marathon. Didn’t hit my A goal, but pretty happy with the result. Highly recommend Grandma’s but be ready to wait in some lines. Don’t be dumb like me and leave your gear on the lawn while you wait forever to pee before the race.  Excellent signage and support from fans, including “If Trump can run, so can you” and “Leo would have stopped at 25.”\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

Initially, I had a structured 12-week HM plan that I was set to follow, unfortunately, life got in the way. The past few months have been extremely busy with working and trying to complete my Master Thesis. And then, in April, I had a death in the family that I, admittedly, did not cope well with mentally at all - mostly boiling down to living so far from my family who are living in the US. This led me to have very little energy/motivation to want to continue training. \n\n\nA couple of weeks after the death of my grandfather, I decided that I needed to get out and start training again for my mental health and to *try* to get into some sort of half marathon shape. Instead of following a structured plan, I ran about 3-4 times per week at a very slow pace (6:30-6:45 per km average pace typically), averaging between 24 and 40 km per week leading up to race weekend. I added in some routes with some elevation, although this is a bit difficult to find in Köln since it is a relatively flat city. I also decided to join two running clubs to try to have some sort of accountability for the runs. \n\n\nMy goal for the past couple of HM races was to break the 2-hour mark. With the lack of (structured) training, and the fact that I am also training for Challenge Roth in July, I decided that I would just go out and have fun on race day and enjoy the atmosphere. I have also decided to make some changes in my life, limiting my alcohol consumption to near zero - only having a very rare drink for a special dinner or special occasion with friends. Last year, I ran this same course, overweight and hungover, finishing with a time of 2:33:23. \n\n\n### Pre-race\nI went through my normal ritual the night before - laying out my gear and nutrition so that I would only have to worry about showering and eating breakfast when I woke up. Breakfast consisted of a simple oatmeal with honey, cinnamon, and a banana. I also drank a bottle of water, small bottle of Powerade and a salt tablet - to try to avoid any early dehydration in the race. The only thing I adjusted to my pre-race routine was to not have coffee.\n\n\nFor anyone who cares, my race day uniform consisted of black Nike Aeroswift running tights, Nike compression arm sleeves, and a bright orange Nike Aeroswift singlet. The chosen shoes were bright yellow New Balance Supercomp Elite v3. \n\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the goals may seem a bit out of place - to not fall during the race. Thanks to some very unfortunate luck (or more likely due to my clumsiness), I have tripped and fallen in my past two races. Because of this, there was a mental block I wanted to overcome in this race, so I decided one of my goals for this race would be to not allow gravity to overcome me. \n\n\nI then headed out of my apartment, took a 25-minute train ride to Leverkusen, walked about 15 minutes to the race zone and then headed over to the bag drop. After dropping off my bag, I ate (or drank?) one apple flavored Decathlon gel and then headed over to the starting area to get a short stretch in. \n\n\nAs a side note, I apologize for listing all of the specific brands that I used - it is moreso for me to refer back to for future races. \n\n### Race\nThe final chip time was not a concern for me, so I was unnaturally calm before the starting gun went off - I am usually a nervous wreck prior to the start of the races I participate in. The game plan was to line up behind the 2:15 pacer and take gels after 45 minutes and 90 minutes (cola-flavored Powerbar Gel). There were only two thoughts going through my head - *\"start slow\"* and *\"don't fall.*\"\n\n\nAs soon as the gun went off, my plan completely fell apart. I thought I was running at a slow pace, but, as I looked down at my watch, after kilometer 1: 5:22 average. *\"Fuck.\"* After kilometer 2: 5:05 average. *\"FUCK.\"* To clarify, I *HAD NOT* trained anywhere near this pace. I was sure that I would not be able to sustain this pace and would crash pretty early on.\n\n\nThat early, metaphorical crash did not come. I was actually feeling fantastic coming up on the first water station at kilometer 5. This is where things went awry. This section of the course is extremely narrow, consisting of a narrow asphalt path with a very slight grassy slope on either side. After grabbing a cup of water, I started to run off, but the woman directly in front of me decided that it would be a good idea to come to a complete stop in the middle of the path to drink her water. Due to the proximity of all of the runners, and the momentum from running, I tried my best to try to go around the woman to not crash into her. Unfortunately, my left foot landed on muddy patch of grass, twisting my ankle, and then gravity once again bested me. The pain from the ankle roll was immediate, but the annoyance of falling in a race AGAIN was more powerful than the ankle pain. I was on the ground for a few seconds trying to assess the damage. Quite a few number of runners shouted to see if I was alright and if I needed any help - I told them *\"alles OK,\"* and slowly got up, started to walk, and then attempted to jog. Maybe it was the adrenaline, or maybe it was the annoyance at myself for falling, but I just took off and was running at a pretty decent pace. \n\n\nThis half marathon course has quite a large portion of it running through the forest across dirt and gravel paths. And, for someone who trains in a flat area, there was an unfortunate number of hills throughout the middle portion of the course. The hill training paid off because I was able to pass many people on the uphills. I will admit, this was a bit of an ego boost because I am used to being the person who is being passed for the majority of the race. As the kilometers ticked by, I was still pleasantly surprised that I was keeping up the pace. Right around kilometer 11, I started having the urge to pee, but there was no where to stop because this portion of the race passed right through a residential area. It was not until kilometer 13 that my bladder could not handle it any more. Thankfully there was a forested section coming up and I was able to empty my bladder a bit off course. \n\n\nAfter the glorious relief, I settled back into a comfortable pace. Looking down at my watch I was still astounded at the time I was currently cruising at. Despite the fall earlier on in the race, I felt absolutely fantastic on the run. I even skipped a water station - something I had never done in any race prior to this one. It blew my mind that I was well on my way to break my personal best time of 2:01:09.\n\n\nI then started to hit the wall right around kilometer 16. My body started to fatigue quite a bit, and also started to have a pretty strong cramp in my stomach as well. Looking down at my watch, I quickly did a mental calculation, and decided that if I slowed down to about 6:30 per kilometer for the last portion of the race, I would still come in around my personal best time. As I was slowing down to start walking, another runner came up beside me and sternly said, *\"No. I will not let you walk. Come, follow my pace.\"* Thankfully, this allowed me to overcome the barrier, ran together for about half a kilometer and then I said thank you and took off. \n\n\nLooking down at my watch, the under 2-hour mark was well in reach. So for the final 4 kilometers I decided to \"send it.\" The last portion of the race is very special. The crowd support is great and you also run through the Bayarena - Bayer 04 Leverkusen's home stadium. Despite being tired, and as the finish line came into view, I started to sprint. The ending was a blur of excitement and fatigue. I looked at my time. 1:55:26. I was in complete shock - I could not believe it.\n\n\n### Post-race\nAfter getting the medal, I walked over to where my friends and coworkers were waiting. One of my friends also ran a personal best in the half marathon, so it was smiles and hugs all around for the both of us. All in all, I am overjoyed at the outcome of the race, and I still don't quite understand how I was able to achieve the time I ran. Now that a few days have passed, I have reflected on the race and now believe that the thought of my grandfather may have been what helped me push through the pain. \n\n\nNow it is time to focus on finishing training to try to survive Challenge Roth in a few weeks. Sorry for the long write-up y'all. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Finally achieved my goal of running under 2 hours for a HM race. Almost completely eliminated drinking alcohol. Beat my previous course time by 37 minutes year-over-year, and beat my previous personal best time by 6 minutes with unstructured training. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

As an early career frontline healthcare worker, the preceding 3 years had really taken a toll on both my mental and physical well-being, and I felt like I finally had the bandwidth to carve out some time for myself to cope with the burnout. I have never, ever considered myself to be an athletic or fit person before. Until I started running, I had struggled with being overweight and having a dysfunctional relationship with food for as long as I can remember; I used to dread gym class and never grew up playing any sports, so I just assumed I didn't have it in me.\n\nIt started with Orange Theory Fitness classes that a friend invited me to. Those initial months absolutely kicked my previously-sedentary butt, but being able to meet up, get destroyed together, and then finish off with a brunch catch-up was so motivating. Very quickly, I started noticing how much better I was sleeping at night (as a shift-worker, this was truly a game-changer), how much happier I felt, and how much more reserve I had for the daily stresses at work. I was hooked. As classes became more expensive, I decided to buy a cheap folding treadmill and some dumbbells to fit in some extra sessions at home, and gradually that morphed into fully transitioning into my own workout routines at home or outside with friends.\n\nInitially, it was just comfortably-paced 20-30min runs on the treadmill 2-3 times a week while watching guilty-pleasure reality shows in the background to keep me distracted (Below Decks, anyone?). Then I started stretching out my runs to 30-45min so I could finish a whole episode in a session (turns out binging a good show is an excellent motivator too). Then last fall, a friend invited me for an outdoor shoreline run where we ended up chatting the whole time and completing an 18.5km loop before I'd even realized it. That was when the seed was first planted to even consider tackling a half marathon - I figured if 18.5km felt doable, 21km might just be achievable. To give myself a goal to work towards, I went home that night, looked up scenic half marathons in Canada, and signed up for my first running race with the Banff Half marathon the following spring. In my eagerness, I failed to factor in the challenges of elevation or hill climbs on the race course; that realization hit later...\n\n# Training\n\nMy goal for this first race was simply to finish injury-free. Work was so busy over the fall/winter period that I simply tried to keep up my routine of at least 2-3 basic workouts per week, so I wasn't able to start any dedicated race training until about 3 months in advance. I tried to loosely follow some half marathon training plans I found online (Strava, Running Room, Nike, etc), but quickly found that with my shift-work schedule, it was too difficult to stick to a rigid plan. Post-night shifts, my body just wasn't up for much physical exertion. So I simply aimed for 3-5 scheduled runs per week, with the vast majority lasting between 30-60min at a comfortable Zone 2 pace (for me, that is 10kph which is what my cheap folding treadmill maxed out at). Once every couple of weeks, I would fit in a longer run (90min). And although I had well-intentioned plans to fit in some hill runs and interval/Fartlek style runs as well, my treadmill just didn't have the features that would allow me to do that indoors and it was a rainy spring where I live (and I am normally a fair-weather runner), so that was out too.\n\nAbout a month into run training, I started to notice left hip pain and right ankle pain whenever I pushed beyond the 5km mark, so I booked a physiotherapy session to troubleshoot. Like so many runners before me, I learned that my glutes needed strengthening and my calves needed stretching. Hip pain? Knee pain? Ankle pain? It almost always comes back to a weak butt and tight calves. So I started incorporating weight-lifting and a proper stretching routine into my training to improve strength/stability and range of motion. Bought myself a set of adjustable dumbbells (on-sale Nuobells after doing a bunch of online research) and got to work. The near-immediate resolution of my joint pains were enough to keep me motivated to keep going with the new routine.\n\nAbout a month before race-day, I planned a trial-run of the race course in Banff to get a proper sense of the terrain, which I'm very glad I did so I could properly pace myself on race-day. The Banff Half Marathon is an out-and-back course along some beautiful lakes and mountain valleys, but there is a decent amount of climbing that really hits you on the way back when you're already gassed, so you need to be mentally prepared and leave a little reserve in the tank towards the end. That was my first time ever running a 21k distance and I was able to complete it in 2:06. Having never raced before, I didn't really know if that was a good time or not, but it felt comfortable for me and I decided I wanted to try for sub-2h on race day as a stretch-goal, depending on how my body was feeling.\n\nAbout 2 weeks out, I started to taper back my runs on the advice of an experienced friend/mentor. Mostly just focusing on 60min easy zone 2 runs at the 2 week mark, and 30min easy runs at the 1 week mark.\n\nIt took me a while to pay proper attention to nutrition. When I first started amping up my training, I was definitely not getting enough protein. I had lost about 10kg of weight (and was within a normal weight range for the first time in my life), but I noticed I was bruising easily and it felt like it was taking longer to recover after workouts. Once I increased my protein intake targets to the recommended 1.5g/kg/day and started actually tracking macros (using an app called MacroFactor and a food scale), I felt way better, the bruising stopped, I had more energy, and I had a bunch of new baby hairs growing out too (I hadn't even noticed the hair loss). I wish I had been more attentive to my nutrition plan from the get-go, but I'm just grateful I didn't sustain any major injuries in the early stages of training.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nDay before the race: I did a shakeout run of 5k over 30min on my treadmill and then forced myself to stop there even though I felt really good and wanted to keep going. My nutrition plan was to try and carb load the day before the race and I was initially aiming for the recommended 10g/kg of body weight in carbs, but only managed to hit about 4g/kg before I was carbed out and decided to call it a day.\n\nDay of the race: I didn't sleep well the night before my race. Not sure if it was the carb-loading or the nerves, but I only managed about 4h of sleep and couldn't seem to get back to sleep, so settled for just resting in bed and chilling out to some music until it was time to get up. I got up around 3h before the race to eat 2 bananas, a toasted english muffin (would have gone for a bagel, but we were out), and a glass of pedialyte with a few glasses of water to pre-hydrate. Then drove out with my husband to arrive at the race location about 30min before the start of the race itself to get my bearings and do some warm-ups.\n\n# Race\n\nThe weather proved to be a bit of a curveball. I had done all my runs in fair weather conditions, but the day of the race, it was on the cooler side (8 degrees Celsius, which was okay-ish) and rainy (which was not so great). Despite wearing wool socks, my feet were soaked before the race even began, but I had a light rain shell on top of my running gear to keep the rest of me dry and decided that I would just feel extra proud if I could finish my first race in sub-optimal weather conditions.\n\nI positioned myself at the 2:15 target time marker at the start of the race because I was surprised to see how close to the front the 2:00 marker was and it made me feel a bit self-conscious as a first-timer (it actually had me questioning whether I had run the correct course during my trial run a month prior, even though I was pretty sure I had followed the posted course map). The energy of the crowd and the other runners was so enjoyable and different from the experience of running solo!\n\nThe first five kilometers were pure adrenaline and I knew I was running significantly faster than I had ever done during my training runs, so I did a quick check-in and decided to slow down a little until I was back to the comfortable running pace from my training runs that I knew I could sustain. My plan was to aim for a negative split, where I ran at my comfortable zone 2 maintenance pace for the first half of the race, and then depending on how I felt at the half-way point, I would start to push a slightly faster pace for the second half. Since my goal was simply to finish the race at all, I didn't focus on split times, but rather I ran at what felt comfortable to me in the moment and found a few runners who seemed to be maintaining a similar speed as pacing buddies at variable points along the course (although I noticed that I'd usually have to shift pacing buddies during hill climb sections as different people handled the hill climbs differently). I tried to hydrate with some gatorade at the 5k hydration station as well, but I had a lot of trouble actually drinking from the cup while moving and probably 3/4 of it ended up splattered all over my face and rain shell instead. After that, I decided that hydration stations were not worth it (and I had done all of my training runs with only pre-hydration, but no hydration during the runs themselves since I hate carrying things while I'm running and I find vests/belts to cause too much chafing).\n\nI took my first energy gel at the 7k mark and my second one at the 14k mark, but in future I think I'll pack a third one to help with the last 5k, which I found to be mentally the most challenging. At the halfway mark turnaround point (after a section of continuous climbing), I decided that I still felt pretty good energy-wise, so I upped my pace a little and decided I would push for a sub-2h finishing time.\n\nThe last 5km were the hardest. I'm not sure if it was because I was bonking (esp since I hadn't been able to fully carb-load in the 24h lead-up to the race and hadn't slept well the night before), or if I just hadn't quite trained enough, but it felt like time slowed down to a crawl those last few km and my legs felt so heavy. I was still on track for a <2h finish if I could keep it up, but I had to keep telling myself how close I was and that I could do this.\n\nAnd then, less than 1km from the finish line, just as I was coming back into Banff and gearing up for the final push, the race marshalls stopped us at the train tracks for a passing freight-train. Although there were timing mats on either side of the train tracks to subtract our waiting time from our final race finish time, it was really tough to be so, so close and to have to stop at that point. I tried to keep myself warm by jogging in place, but the cold started to seep in and I started to notice how wet my socks were and how stiff my muscles were starting to feel. Unfortunately, it also bunched the runners up again; prior to stopping, we were nicely spread out coming into the finish, but once we were given the go ahead to cross the tracks after the train had finally passed, I had to sprint to find some open space coming into the finish and then try to keep that pace going for 500m.\n\nOne last push when the finish line came into sight brought me to a final sprint over the finish line at 1:54:38; better than I could have hoped for with my first race. I finished 168th/1130 participants, 50th/704 for my gender group, and 13th/156 for my division (F30-34).\n\n# Post-race\n\nI ate a giant bowl of tonkotsu ramen in Canmore and then went home to enjoy home-made wagyu steak for Father's Day dinner with my family (my brother sourced and cooked the Wagyu and I made the sides and supplied some homemade Ninja Creami ice cream for dessert).\n\nI'm not sure I will ever have the desire to pursue a full marathon, but a year ago I never would have thought it possible to complete a half marathon either, so I suppose you never know! I'm absolutely hooked on running now and I'm hoping to plan for 1-2 annual races to keep me motivated. I'd like to eventually aim for a <90min half marathon time, but more than any particular race goals, I'm hoping to keep running as a lifelong sport, so I'm going to continue focusing on injury-free running and cross-training to keep my joints and muscles healthy.\n\nI haven't quite convinced myself that I am an athlete yet, but I'm getting there :)",

I really wanted to do something physical and I was between bike riding and running with running winning out merely because of the low start up costs. I was pretty consistent, going from couch to 5k and then running my first 10k within a few months and even running through a rough Canadian winter. I signed up for my first half-marathon in spring of 2022 but my second child was born that winter and, unlike the first, he didn't sleep through the night until he was over a year old and it really messed up my ability to train. Undertrained and extremely tired, I was still going to attempt the half, but the morning of there was a heat wave that saw temperatures hit low 30's (86F+) and I honestly thought I would have a heart attack and die so I didn't even go to the start line. While runners were able to complete that half, the full marathon was cancelled part way through in a spectacularly bungled fashion and I was very happy with my decision not to run.\n\nFast forward to last year, my youngest started sleeping which allowed me to take up running seriously again. I slowly regained my fitness and volunteered as race marshals until attempting another 10k in the fall. It didn't go great as I ran it with a chest cold (not advised) but I told myself it was my last 10k. Next year I would run two half marathons followed by a full the year after.\n\n# Training\n\nI found a training plan online that fit my schedule (The sub 2 hour half marathon plan from Runners World UK) and almost completely stuck to it, adding a little bit of speed to the tempo sessions and a little bit of distance to most runs but overall no serious issues. I twinged my back in week 3 but was able to still get all the runs in (just slower) and my wife was out of town for week 9 so I missed a single run during my taper but this is by far the most on track I've ever been for a training plan. I didn't even get sick, which I was certain would happen sooner or later (due to the aformentioned two children). I had a little hip pain later in the training as well but I just started dong the Myrtle routine and that remedied it fairly quickly.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI went with a 3 day carb-load which mostly consisted of bagels and graham crackers. It was our anniversary on race week and my wife and I went to a Nordik spa the day before the race itself. I made sure to drink an insane amount of water at the spa to help counteract the (moderate) use of saunas and I kept out of the hot tub the entire evening, focusing mostly on relaxing the entire day.\n\nThe night of the race there was a thunderstorm, which kept my dog up so I slept on the downstairs couch to keep her company during the storm. It wasn't the best sleep, but I figured the extra rest I got the the day before would help offset any major fatigue. I did have to wake up my wife and two kids very early in order to drive me to the race, which of course nobody liked, but we all agreed that was part of my father's day present so the resentment was taken in stride.\n\nThe thunderstorm (and shelter in place order) ended right as I got to the starting venue, which was a medium sized football stadium at a local university. I had just enough time to check my bag, use the toilet, limber up, and find my pace group before things got really tightly packed. I think all the events in this race were sold out and it was definitely the biggest group of runners I had seen to date (not really that many, maybe 5,000 people, just all squished together with me in the middle).\n\n# Race\n\nThe gun went off and both the Marathon and Half Marathon started at the same time. My plan was to stay with my pacer through the first half and then push for the second, but that was mostly thrown out the window as I was lost in the sea of bodies. For the first 5k my pacer was probably 50-100m in front of me despite me going faster than 2 hour pace for most of that. I eventually caught up to him at 7k and stayed only for a couple more kilometers when I just felt it was too slow and I wanted to go faster. I picked up the pace around the 10k mark and was cruising until about the last 5k when fatigue started to creep in but told myself I would push through. I wanted to feel the pain cave everyone talks about and was definitely getting close near the end.\n\nThis wasn't a perfect race. The course was lovely, flat, and scenic, but while the temperature was great there was still quite a bit of humidity from the thunderstorm and I made sure to use every cooling off station available. While the course was flat there was a noticeable camber to many of the streets which really didn't agree with my shoe choice, the Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro 2, which started to hurt my ankles fairly early on. I tried running in the middle of most streets, but that quickly proved impossible and I had to alternate between slanted to the right and slanted to the left sides to keep my ankles even. My left shoe also had some considerable rubbing in the toe box which was quite painful during the run and led to a blood blister post race. I like these shoes for straight, flat, and fast but for distance and turns they were less than desirable.\n\nThis was accentuated during the last kilometer of the race when all runners (and walkers) from every distance are inexplicably funnelled into the same narrow tunnel that leads into the stadium and finish line. This meant that at my very fastest, when I was touching the pain cave, I had to litereally deek in and out of hundreds of walkers, family's doing the fun run, and people pushing their hardest to finish a 10k along with all my fellow half-marathoners. It was insane, I'm shocked I didn't hit anyone. Then, to top it all off for the last 100m or so you're running on a curve inside the stadium towards the finish line on the astroturf, which after 21kms of concrete felt like quicksand with no grip. I pushed my hardest and finished the race in a sea of people in the middle of the stadium. A friend said they heard my name on the announcement and that I got a sub 2 but I missed it in my semi-delirious state and couldn't even find where the official times were and had to look myself up on the app to even see how I did.\n\n# Post-race\n\nImmediately after finishing I was given my medal and wandered a little until seeing the way to exit the stadium was walking up many stairs to the upper concourse. I was ok but imagine finishing a marathon and then needing to walk multiple flights of stairs just to leave the venue. The worse part was that it was all extremely congested and probably took me 25 minutes to get from the bottom of the stairs, through the chocolate milk and banana stations to where my bag pick up was and into my recovery sandals that allowed me to walk like a normal human. I'm assuming I finished at just the worst possible time for maximum congestion and for most runners it wasn't so bad, but for me it was. I eventually met up with my family and we went out for donuts and I enjoyed a relaxing fathers day.\n\nSo yes, a fairly successful race and great experience (with times eerily close to u/BuroraAurorealis as predicted a couple weeks ago) but now I need to rest up my ankles before starting training the the next one. :)\n\nEdit: Just fixing some spelling.\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

        "Texto": "**Death by 5K – Waterloo, IA**\n\n**Saturday May 18****^(th)****, 2024**\n\n**Race Details:**\n\nThe RunStrong event, Death by 5k, requires participants to run, walk, skip, scrawl TEN 5ks over a 24-hour period. Each 5k starting 2.5 hours apart beginning at 8:00 am, 10:30 am, 1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, 6:00 pm, 8:30 pm, 11:00 pm, 1:30 am, 4:00 am, and finally at 6:30 am. You will receive a single bib and each 5k is chip-timed. The 2024 races were held in Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas, and Alabama. This is the event’s second year at the Waterloo, IA location. I’m hoping they expand to the Kansas City location next year!\n\n**How I Got Signed Up:**\n\nTen years ago, I decided to be a runner and cover 1000 miles over the course of 2014. I barely made the cut and reached my goal in the second half of December. When the 9-year-old timehop photo of my charted miles reared its head in December of 2023, I knew what I had to do. It was time to revisit the 1000-mile challenge I had set for myself once again.\n\nLittle did I know that I would receive a text from an internet friend on December 29^(th) regarding Death by 5K. Friend was considering signing up but said that $150 sounded crazy for a 5k. I too thought $150 was a little steep… until I clicked on the link and read more. It wasn’t only one, but TEN 5ks. I browsed the site a bit and looked at the other race locations for 2024. Being from Kansas City, the race in Waterloo, IA seemed like my best bet. I also liked that it was taking place in May. Not too hot and not too cold.\n\nWas I really going to sign up for essentially running 31 miles over a 24 hour stretch after not having run for ten years?\n\nJanuary 4^(th), 2024 – Yep.\n\n**Training Before Race:**\n\nGetting back into the swing of running was easier than I thought it was going to be. After the beginning / middle of January I was averaging 35 miles a week. I continued to dabble in my other activities of walking the dog, strength training, and Peloton spin classes. I ran a few 5k races, a 10k, and even signed up for a half marathon in April with just 5 weeks to train for it.\n\nWhile I wasn’t always the best at stretching before runs, I did try to stretch afterwards. I even started incorporating some more lengthy 20 minute stretches most nights.\n\nI had tackled walking 50k and 100k steps in a single day before, it was the lack of sleep that worried me. That wasn’t something I was going to “train” for though, so guess I would just cross that sleep-deprived bridge when I got to it.\n\n**Best Surprise Ever:**\n\nMy husband was initially going just to support me, but ended up signing up for the race without telling me. Approximately two weeks before the event, he surprised me that he'd be running it too. While I was running \\~35 miles each week, my husband was running a wee fraction of that. It was bound to make for an interesting experience.\n\n**Course:**\n\nWaterloo, IA - George Wyth State Park – Canfield Shelter – Out & Back on Cedar Valley Lakes Trail (PAVED!). The trail was marked with white signs with red arrows. 32 Feet of elevation. Wooded non-lit trail, along the side a highway, through more wooded trails. Very pretty trail. Saw turkey and deer the way in, but nothing really while running. Bugs were horrid during the 8:30pm run, but otherwise were not too bad (possibly due to the lower night temps).\n\n**Swag**:\n\nParticipants receive a Death by 5k event shirt, cup, koozie, temporary tattoo, and stickers. If you finish the 50k challenge, you will also receive a handmade finisher’s coffin. Also available for purchase were event hats, hoodies, tanks, t-shirts. Other products you could buy (in case you forgot to pack your own) were socks, saltstick chews, headlamps, sunglasses, and bib belts.\n\n**Everything Packed – Why did we pack it and did we end up needing it?**\n\n\\~Camp Setup\\~\n\n*Canopy, Zero Gravity Bench, (3) Chairs, (2) Yoga Mats, Towel, Snuggies, KU Blanket*\n\nA resounding YES. The canopy kept us shaded. The bench reclined so we could relax and “sleep”. The chairs provided a nice place to sit and eat our meals. The yoga mats kept at least a little separation between our bags and the grass. The Snuggies and blankets came in handy during the night when the temperature dropped.\n\n\\~Clothing\\~\n\n*(5) Sports Bras, (4) Running Shorts, (5) Pairs Socks, (5) Tops, Sweatpants, Sweatshirt, Junk Headbands, Hat, (2) Pairs Tennis Shoes, Running Waist Packs, Bibboards*\n\nI packed so many changes of clothing because the weather was predicting rain for the longest time. Luckily it never came. I could have gotten by with way less bras, shorts, socks, and tops, but I am glad I packed them in case the rain did show up. The sweatpants and sweatshirt were worn in between races at night and super great to have. The hat was NOT used (I packed it in case of rain). I only ended up using one pair of my tennis shoes but wanted a second pair in case one of them got wet. The running waist bags were used every single run to hold our phones. The Bibboards were used to secure our bibs to our clothing, however RunStrong provided bib ties you could have purchased. The ones they sold honestly seemed like a solid option too.\n\n\\~Electronical Devices & Lights\\~\n\n*(1) Body Light, (2) Head Lamps, (2) Shoe Lights, (2) Flashlights, Reading Lights, (2) Headphones, Power Strip, (3) Halos, Fan*\n\nBody lights, head lamps, shoe lights were all used during the night runs. We could have used more light up stuff to be honest, but what we had sufficed. Flashlights were used traversing to and from our canopy. Headphones were used to listen to music every run. Two of the three HALO chargers were used in between runs to recharge our phones. We did NOT use the reading lights (didn’t want to attract more bugs), but I would have if we had a tent. We also did NOT use the power strip or fan. To be fair, those items were packed to use at the hotel the night before Death by 5k, and they WERE used then.\n\n\\~Medicine Cabinet Things\\~\n\n*Ibuprofen & Aleve, Capsaicin patches, Voltarin, Band-Aids, Neosporin, B12, Sunscreen, Bug Spray*\n\n*Knee braces (small and large), Bug Bite Thing, Tick Remover, Deodorant, Body Glide*\n\nLuckily a lot of these things were packed just in case we had the misfortune of needing them. The good news is that we didn’t need a lot of it, but I would still pack everything listed above all over again. We did use the Ibuprofen and Aleve and boy did those come in handy a little over halfway through. We did not use Capsaicin patches, Voltarin, or Neosporin. I did have to break out the Band-Aids as I developed starting blisters on my toes during one of the runs. I would have been in some pain without them! We did pop a B12 for a little bit of energy, but it probably wasn’t needed. The sunscreen and bug spray were applied LIBERALLY throughout the entire 24 hours, and I would never consider NOT packing these. Deodorant and Body Glide came into good use, especially when the chafing kicked in. We did not end up needing the knee braces (yay), the bug bite thing (despite the ample number of bugs), or the tick remover (THANK YOU).\n\n\\~Miscellaneous\\~\n\n*(1) Foam Roller, Book, Football, Toilet Paper, Wet Wipes / Body Wipes*\n\nThe foam roller was used when my back ached during the later runs, and I did get a solid chunk of my book read. We did NOT use the football, but maybe we would have if we had gone with a group of people? While we did not use the extra toilet paper or the body wipes, I would still pack them. The porta-potties got dangerously low on TP, and that is not something you want to be without.\n\n**What we WISHED we packed**\n\nA tent with an air mattress. Being able to keep out bugs and fully lay down would have helped immensely. A tarp to separate us from the ground, and furthermore a folding table to keep our bags off the ground. We were shooing spiders and other bugs right and left. Lastly a bag for trash just so we didn’t have to trek to the trash can at the pavilion each time to throw something away. Overall, I think we did a pretty good job packing things we might have needed during the 24-hour race.\n\nFood Packed: Honestly, we came unprepared. I packed energy drinks, electrolyte drinks, lemonade mix packets, Peeps candy, and gum. While we were supplied with more hot meals, snacks, and drinks than we thought possible, I now know next time to pack some fruit! I could have really gone for an apple after any one of those runs.\n\n**Food Provided**\n\nHot meals were provided after every other race. Snacks and drinks were provided throughout the entire event.\n\nBreakfast #1: Pancakes and bacon\n\nLunch: Chicken and cheese quesadillas\n\nDinner #1: Pizza\n\nMid-Night Dinner #2: Chicken noodle soup\n\nBreakfast #2: Chocolate pancakes and bacon\n\nAssorted Snacks Provided: peanut butter crackers, trail mix, mini muffins, powdered and chocolate mini donuts, ruffles, applesauce, vanilla and chocolate snackpaks, goldfish crackers, Oreos, mini rice crispy treats, soft batch cookies, & Nutri grain bars. We did NOT go hungry.\n\nDrinks: Water, Gatorade, and coffee\n\n**HERE’S A RUN DOWN OF EACH INDIVIDUAL RACE:**\n\n**Run #1 8:00 am – 34:18**\n\n*67F and clear sunny skies*\n\nFirst run done and not regretting my decision to sign up. Ran at a very manageable pace. Ate pancakes, bacon, and a pack of mini muffins. Read some of my book. A bit breezy in the tent, so I’m glad that we packed the Snuggies.\n\n**Run #2 10:30 am – 34:58**\n\n*76F still clear and sunny*\n\nRun was definitely hotter and we still paced slow. It is fully sunny out, but luckily about two thirds of the path is shaded by trees. Drank some Gatorade, ate applesauce, mini powdered donuts, a mini rice crispy treat, and a leftover chicken wrap with sweet potato fries from last night. Tried to read some more but didn’t get much accomplished.\n\n**Run #3 1:00 pm – 35:49**\n\n*88F and VERY sunny*\n\nPace has become even slower. Ryan got very overheated at the end of the run. He had to immediately sit down and then cover his head in some water. Chicken and cheese quesadillas for lunch. Ryan might currently be regretting signing up. I am still doing fine. Also snacked on another mini rice crispy treat, a chocolate snack pack, and some leftover pancakes from breakfast.\n\n**Run #4 3:30 pm – 38:05**\n\n*89F but finally some cloud coverage*\n\nPaced dropped even more. Ryan carried Gatorade with him this time and it seemed to help. He didn’t end this run overheated. He says he hasn’t regretted signing up (and neither have I). Talked with Claire, the race director, afterwards. Ate more leftover pancakes with syrup and a piece of chicken and cheese quesadilla. Went back to the canopy and snacked on a mini rice crispy treat and some Oreos. Outfit change into bra, top, and socks number two.\n\n**Run #5 6:00 pm – 37:54**\n\n*85F and partly cloudy still*\n\nPace roughly the same. Ryan carried a water bottle again, but this is getting rough. His knee hurt during the first mile in and then started to feel better(ish)? We got a call out at the finish line by Claire since we talked to her after the previous run. She was so friendly! Had pizza, Oreos, and soft baked cookies afterwards. At this moment Death by 5K is a 7/10 on the hard scale. My only saving grace is the slightly slower speed we are jogging at. Read a little bit in between races. HALFWAY DONE!!!\n\n**Run #6 8:30 pm – 40:03**\n\n*79F and sun was actively setting*\n\nThis run started moderately dark and ended dark. While this was the slowest run so far, it definitely wasn’t the hardest. There were a LOT of bugs though. Those are only going to get worse once we start using our lights for the runs. Still having fun, but I wish we had a tent. Probably not the best idea that both Ryan and I had eaten another slice of pizza approximately five minutes before this run. Grabbed a Nutri grain bar to snack on afterwards before heading back to the canopy. Took one Ibuprofen to dull some minor aches in my knees, feet, and lower back.\n\n**Run #7 11:00 pm – 39:09**\n\n*68F and nighttime*\n\nSuch a fun run! Not as hot so the bugs were surprisingly not as bad. Everyone is generally going slower now because of the low visibility. Pretty run with everyone wearing items that glow or light up. Haven’t been able to sleep yet. Had warm chicken soup and soft batch cookies for a snack. Tried to sleep, couldn’t. At least I was able to rest my eyes a bit. Per Claire, these late-night races are the ones when runners will typically drop out of the event.\n\n**Run #8 1:30 am – 37:54**\n\n*60F and very dark*\n\nNot too different from the previous run, except we were able to finish a little faster. The first two minutes of the run were a little chilly, and then what I was wearing (tank top and shorts) was adequate. Both of us are getting a little chafed from the repeated running. It is both believable and not believable that we only have two more runs left. Had a leftover slice of pepperoni pizza and two mini rice crispy treats. Will try to sleep again, but my lower back, hips, knees, and feet are really feeling it. SUCCESS! I was able to catch about 30-40 minutes of sleep.\n\n**Run #9 4:00 am – 41:13**\n\n*56 and still nighttime*\n\nChilly enough now to run in a light sweater. Slowest pace so far, but it was the penultimate race, and we are running on less than an hour of sleep. Feeling very accomplished with just the final run being less than 2.5 hours away. Probably won’t be able to sleep before it. Breakfast after this run was chocolate pancakes and bacon. Also had *another* mini rice crispy treat (these are a weakness of mine if you could not tell) and a Nutri grain bar for a snack. A dog from another runner wandered over for 25 minutes while their owner slept, so we got some pets in.\n\n**Run #10 6:30 am – 38:27**\n\n*55F and the sun is rising, but it is party cloudy*\n\nWE DID IT! Neither of us walked a single run. I wore my light sweater again, and that was a little toasty by the end of the 3.1 miles. It was nice actually being able to see the trail though. We got our handmade coffin trophies, ate a slice of pizza, and we’re back off to Kansas City (after a quick power nap at our motel in an actual BED)!\n\n \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAll in all the race directors made sure we were well fed and that the trail was clearly marked, and the junior race director made sure we knew when it was time to go to the starting line. They’re expanding to more locations each year, and I’m putting all the positive thoughts I can that Kansas City is one of the next ones on the list.\n\n**10/10 would do again (just not anytime in the immediate future).**\n\n[https://deathby5k.com/](https://deathby5k.com/)\n\nWE FINISHED!!\n\n([https://postimg.cc/MnKcQNXn](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/postimg.cc/MnKcQNXn__;!!H6meKgS6!ILB4XOkkO2Eg6PIIpVMQBFKTpmKhkdwPaHEu50fe98SFw3eu626RYpv_f9S87mJdcE1IEvowAbosza7q-dMI6Zp_wxgjHKgBmA$))"

Well - since then I sustained a pretty severe stress tibial stress fracture (July probably but then I ran on it for a month because what is pain but a minor inconvenience?), spent 3 months on crutches (mid August-mid November), started PT (December), completed a return-to-run program (February), and then slowly ramped up mileage while battling complications with just about every other part of my left leg (which had decided to retire while I was on crutches).\n\nBecause of my schedule, I ran 5 easy miles before work on Thursdays and Saturdays, long run (got up to 11 miles) on Mondays, and another 5 miles on Tuesdays which started out as more easy miles but turned into some low key speed workouts towards the end. My peak week was 27+ miles and I didn't really taper - ran 8 last Monday, 5 on Tuesday, and a quick 5k shake out on Thursday. I also did 30-45m of mobility/PT every day, an hour of strength training daily, and rode the exercise bike on the days I didn't run.\n\nGetting to the start line was really the A goal; I didn't have any illusions of grandeur (or PRs). My PT thought it was unlikely I could run sub 2:00 which I thought was a little out of touch given the paces I ran during my long runs, but I was also battling big mental challenges around trusting my left leg so I was trying to keep pace goals out of it.\n\n### Pre-race\nGot up at 5, did some mobility, and then had breakfast (bagel/pb + coffee). Did a little rolling then headed out. I had some LMNT on the drive over. This was not a big event (like 150 starters in the HM) and only 20min from my house, so very low stress. The weather was absolutely beautiful with a light breeze and low humidity. I had plenty of time to check in, walk around, do some dynamic warmup, change shoes, etc. I had half a bag of Skratchers gummies about 30min before the start and a piece of MEG caffeine gum about 10-15min before the start. I carried a handheld water bottle and my own fuel even though there were aid stations.\n\n### Race\n90% of this race was on a paved canal trail that I run all the time, so I was already familiar with most of the course (part of the reason I chose this race).\n\nMile 1-4 - I was relatively near the front to start (not that hard, not that many people), but the race started across some not manicured grass and rocks which is super fun in road shoes (adidas pro 3 - decidedly not off-roading shoes lol) and then went to a narrow paved trail that was about 2 people wide. We popped out onto the main canal trail after about .25mi(ish) and went right up a small steep hill and then it was just pretty flat. I had already decided to not look at my watch for the duration so I just settled in and cruised along. The turnaround was around 3.5 and I took a couple SaltStick chews around Mile 4.\n\nMile 5-8 - I had my first gel (Maurten 100) at Mile 5. Around 6 we crossed paths with the turnaround for the 5k that started 30min after us. There was a little congestion until we passed the point where they turned back into the park but not too bad. At Mile 8 I checked in with myself and felt really good - everything felt smooth and no pain.\n\nMile 9-10 - This was the toughest part for me because it took me down the canal trail further than I've ever run and I had no idea where the turnaround was (still hadn't looked at my watch and there weren't markers at every mile). We did eventually turn around at about 9.5 and I had another gel at 10 (Maurten 100 Caffeine).\n\nMile 11-12 - Starting to feel ready to be done; getting a little hot and feeling a little slow but nowhere near hitting a wall. I was running all alone and definitely lacking the motivation to push too much without company.\n\nMile 13 - I came down the last little decline and suddenly had someone running next to me. When she didn't fly by me I realized I could keep pace with her if I pushed just a little. It felt easy - smooth and sustainable for at least a little while. We ran side by side until we re-entered the park on the narrow trail, at which point I'd actually had enough and chose to maintain while she kept pushing faster. Once we got over the uneven grass and rocks and onto the flat grass, I had enough left to kick on to the end - and got my first look at my time.\n\nI crossed the finish line and grabbed my medal, then glanced at my watch and saw that it was reading a little short (not surprising since it had buzzed late for every mile marker I passed) - so I weaved through some people and kept running down the access road until I was at 13.2 (overkill, but whatever). \n\n### Post-race\nWalked back to my truck, had a banana and some water, checked the live results online and saw that I was 3rd in my age group so changed shoes and walked back to the start to pick up my award glass. Walked back to the truck, had a BCAA/electrolyte drink, did a little stretching, and then drove home where I had a nice epsom salt soak.\n\nThe plan is to take a down week (no running/exercise bike only, switch up the strength routine to something different for a few days), and then jump back in to get ready for a HM in mid-September. My goal is to add a 5th day of running, get more dialed in on workouts, and build to 35-40mpw (basically where I was at when I got hurt).\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "Running is an individual sport, but is much better when you have the support of a community. r/running provides that community in an online forum, but many running groups and clubs are scattered throughout the US. I am submitting weekly reviews of different running clubs in different cities over the upcoming weeks - the short list of locations include Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, Kansas City, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Atlanta, Tulsa, Jacksonville, Orlando, and possibly Louisville. I hope you enjoy!\n\nLast week's review: https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1d3mn1k/kansas_city_run_club_shawnee_shawnee_ks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nKung Fu/Washington Ave Run Club - Houston, TX\nMetro: Houston, TX\nMeet dates: Wendesdays at 6:30 PM\nRun date: May 8, 2024\nRoute distance: 3 or 5 miles\nActivity Link: https://www.strava.com/activities/11365452856\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/washingtonaverunningclub?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/KungFuRunningClub/\nStrava: https://www.strava.com/clubs/251036\n\n\nI found myself in Houston again, and I decided to try out Washington avenue Run Club, formerly known as Kung Fu Run Club. This club used to meet at a bar called Kung Fu, but since that bar has closed, they have begun meeting at a bar called HandleBar. Their Strava name is still Kung Fu rum Club, but their Instagram has transitioned over to Washington avenue ru n Club.\n\nTheir most recent Instagram post indicated that check-in began at 6:00, so I promptly showed up at 6:00. The parking lot was wide open, and there appeared to be plenty of parking due to a nearby fitness center. The bar is a neat, but standard Heights area bar that has A good seating area outside and a large bar on the inside with a couple arcade games. I waited until about 6:20 before the other runners showed up. Based some of their Instagram posts, I knew this would be a smaller Club, which which I was excited for.\n\nBy 6:30 pm, A group of ten or so runners had gathered. We all introduced ourselves prior to beginning the run, and the club organizer made sure that everyone was familiar with each other. Half the group did the 3 mile route, and the other half, including myself, did the 5 mile route. \n\nThe 5 mile route heads west before intersecting with Memorial Park and does a full loop of the park before returning to HandleBar. Memorial Park is a meticulously maintained park that surrounds a golf course and consists of a decomposed granite surface. Additionally, this path is significantly wider than your average sidewalk, so even though there is a large amount of people here on a regular basis, it is easy to navigate and move around people. I love running on decomposed granite paths because the surface is closer to a trail than it is to road, so it has less joint impact. Please keep in mind that this will tear up the soles of road-running shoes faster, so if this trail or other decomposed granite paths are part of your regular running routine, it may be wise to invest in trail running shoes.\n\nI stuck with a couple of runners who hovered around 8:00 min/mile pace for the duration of the run. We discussed training strategies and the benefits of training in high heat and humidity, which there is no lack of in the thick of Houston summer months (if you don't know, a few studies show that high heat/humidity training may increase blood plasma volume and, with exposure over multiple weeks, may increase red blood cell count similar to altitude training.) \n\nAfter the run, a group stuck around HandleBar, sharing some drinks and good conversation. The crowd was mostly established professional men, although a few women do frequent the club based on their Instagram. Most of the runners had some sort of training program they were following, so while it is a social club, the level of dedication to running exceeds that of some other Houston-area run clubs. For me, this was a huge plus because I'm always wanting to learn about the training strategies and lifestyles of other dedicated runners. Given that I fit the demographic of this club, this will be high on my list for Houston-area run club revisits.\n",

Last year I ran my first half marathon, the SF first half, in 2:25:01. I used the Nike app and kind of did a few weeks of their half marathon training plan. I then ran the Berkeley half in 2:18:22 and the Oakland half in 2:11:43. \n\nI tend to sign up for all of these events on a whim, so I signed up for the San Jose half on May 19th.\n\n##Training\nAfter the Oakland half, I decided that my next goal was a sub 2 hour half marathon, and I started ramping up to running about 40 miles a week in April. I joined a few run clubs and was running track every Wednesday, which helped tremendously with speed and endurance. I also do a lot of trail running, and I have a 2000 ft weekly elevation goal. \n\nAt the end of April I bought a Coros watch and started the marathon training plan to have some structure in my running. I didn't really do all the workouts because they conflicted with all the other runs I've been doing, but I did get a 15.5 mile long run in the weekend before the San Jose half. \n\nDuring the Oakland half, I ran 11.2 miles and then started walking. My goal was to try to run the entire way this time (minus stopping at aid stations). \n\nI ran a 6:47 mile the day before during a fun mile race in Marin, so I figured I could do an 8:20 to 8:30 pace to get close to 1:50.\n\nCoros predicted my half marathon time would be around 1:56:14.\n\n##Pre-race\nSadly, I had fallen the day before on a trail run, and my knees, left forearm, and right elbow were all scraped up. I was lucky that I iced my knees so they weren't too swollen and I could still run.\n\nI woke up at 5:30, had an LMNT to get some salt, and drove to San Jose. On the way there I got a shaken espresso drink from Starbucks to get some caffeine, and took some acetaminophen/ibuprofen for the scrapes. I also ate a pineapple Edge energy gel. I got to San Jose around 7, and was lucky to find a bathroom at another Starbucks to poop. \n\nI got the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3s that week and I had used them for a couple of runs, but maybe not enough. When I was at the starting line, I knelt down to tie them and some guy kicked me in my injured forearm. I started bleeding.\n\n##Race\nI started out really strong but I think I tied my shoes too tightly, because my feet started to get numb, and then my right foot gradually started hurting more and more. By the halfway point, every step on my right foot was super painful.\n\nA huge annoyance was that the mile markers on the course were off by almost a tenth of a mile. By the end, my watch said 13.28.\n\nI had decided to walk at the aid stations to get water, but I skipped the first one, so I got water after the 5k mark. \n\nI was ahead of the 1:50 pacer until mile 4, and kept them in sight until after mile 8, which was just after the out and back portion that went over a freeway bridge. That part was brutal and you can see that my pace gradually went down from 8:30 to slower than 9:00 per mile. \n\nI had my second energy gel at the halfway point before that bridge. \n\nAt mile 10 I was doing my best to keep running, and any hope of getting close to 1:50 was gone. I was kind of hoping to get below 1:55, but that also seemed really hard. Luckily there were a few more water stations that allowed me to walk briefly. \n\nI was able to keep a more consistent pace for the last three miles and finished with a Strava time of 1:56:18, and a chip time of 1:57:52. \n\nI set PRs in the 5k, 10k, 15k, 10 mile, 20k, and the half.\n\n##Post-race\nI could barely walk, so I went to my car to put on different shoes. My right foot has a huge painful callus on the ball of the foot, but of course I felt amazing 10 minutes after the race ended. \nMy hydration and fueling were good and I think I could have run a sub 1:50 if not for the foot pain. \n\nI'm happy with the consistency I had through most of the run.\n\nNext goal is sub 1:50 with a reach goal of sub 1:45.\n\n Made with [Strava race report generator](https://race-report-gen.jezl.xyz/)."

        "Texto": "TLDR: [Repository for Python program that aggregates and visualizes heart rate and pace zones from Strava activites. ](https://github.com/zwinslett/strava-zone-aggregator)\n\nFor those that use Strava premium, you know that each activity uploaded from a compatible device is saved with heart rate data. Strava natively displays the time spent in each heart rate zone for each activity, but it does not to my knowledge offer a way to view the time spent in each heart rate zone over a given period of time (e.g. \"a week\" or \"a month\"). Additionally, each activity is saved with similarly displayed pace zones with the same limitation. This missing feature of Strava undermines the greatest benefits of zone training by making it difficult to track your level of effort over time, i.e., there's no way to see if you've followed an 80-20 split for example if that's your goal.\n\nIn order to better visualize the percent of time an athlete has spent in each zone over a given period of time, I wrote a [Python program](https://github.com/zwinslett/strava-zone-aggregator) that uses Stava's API to aggregate the zones from each activity in a user-provided date range and visualizes the time spent in each zone as a pie chart. I previously wrote a [Python program that visualizes various forms of running metrics based on what shoe was worn during an activity](https://github.com/zwinslett/strava-shoe-explore) and shared that on Reddit to some interest, so I figured I'd share this program as well.\n\nI wrote this program for personal usage during my own training blocks. It is not an application or website that allows a user to authenticate with Strava and receive results. You'll need to follow the instructions in the readme file and run this locally, but I've attempted to make that as painless as possible and am more than willing to answer questions from Reddit. I currently don't have much of an appetite for incurring the cost of hosting this as a website nor battling the Strava API's rate limiting, but I am more than happy to take feedback on the program and attempt to improve it for others' usage. I also encourage any intrepid runners to fork the project and make their own improvements.\n\nI am a hobbyist programmer, so I cannot guarantee my code is \"Pythonic\" in all cases. I welcome feedback from more seasoned developers. I have generously commented the code in order to improve readability and clarity, which hopefully makes up for any deficiencies. \n\nI look forward to any feedback, and I hope this tool as as helpful as it was fun to create. I also encourage you to share other tools that make this easier for any non-technical runners. It's a shame Strava does not support this natively. I believe [Runnalyze](https://runalyze.com/?_locale=en) does this for those interested in signing up for another service. ",

Since then, life got in the way. I tried a few times to get back into running, but always ended up running too many miles, or too quickly, and injured myself within a month or two of my return. I hadn’t been doing any lifting or any other sports over that time period, either. At 5’10 and 160 lbs, I was pretty solidly skinnyfat.\n\nAbout a year ago (April 2023), I ran with a few work colleagues, a lot slower than I was used to. And, surprise, it didn’t hurt. So I decided to get back into running, but to use my newfound self control as a 34-year-old, to actually not overdo it. Take my time, not injure myself, etc. I ended up running a half marathon last October in 1:41 using Strava Premium’s McMillan training plan. Still injured myself for a few weeks prior to the race, but overall a structured plan helped keep me healthy. At that point I decided I had a goal. Get to Boston. Do it the slow way, but stay as uninjured as possible. So I hired a coach.\n\n##Training\nI started working with my coach in late October 2023. She’s been giving me workouts on VDOT, and we do a group run (she trains about 20 runners in the Fairfield County, CT area) once a week.\n\nI injured myself once (lower back strain) at the beginning of December. I had been adding weighted Russian Twists to my strength training routine, and it turns out those can do a real number on your lower back. But I worked with my coach on a run-walk return to running plan, which was painful in its slowness but got me back on track by the end of February. I’ve found that having the external coach setting rules gives me an accountability mechanism and lets me give myself permission to do less than I want to, from a speed/volume perspective.\n\nWe continued to ramp over the next few months. From the end of March to now, my routine was [pretty consistent](https://i.imgur.com/cIfnyGd.png):\n\n* Monday: 40-60 min easy\n* Tuesday: 40-60 min easy\n* Wednesday: Speedwork - usually a 2 mile warmup, some repeats at threshold, and a 2 mile cooldown\n* Thursday: Rest\n* Friday: 40-60 min easy\n* Saturday: Speedwork - usually a 2 mile warmup, Marathon or Half Marathon pace intervals or progression\n* Sunday: 60-75 min easy\n\nMy maximum mileage leading up to the race was [39mpw](https://i.imgur.com/1m6prPr.png), and that’s also my maximum [over the past year](https://i.imgur.com/gtkA7fM.jpeg). \n\n##Pre-race\nThis was my first time doing any kind of preload for a race. My coach told me to take one LMNT on Thursday (2 days prior to the race), two on Friday, and one on Saturday. I subbed Pedialyte Sport for LMNT because that’s what I had on hand. Frankly, I don’t know if I will repeat this for two reasons:\n\n* [The science doesn’t seem to be there](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ch148w/why_if_most_recent_studies_show_little_to_no/)\n* It had some pretty rough GI effects\n\nBeyond that, I did a single-day carb load (about 8g CHO per kg body weight), and got to sleep early before race day.\n\nOn race day, I schlepped up to Simsbury, CT. Got 5 minutes from my house and realized I’d forgotten my race shoes. Turning around to grab ‘em meant I arrived later than expected, and hampered my warmup. Between trying to park (which sucked) and two trips to the port a potties (see previous comment re: electrolyte drinks), I didn’t have any time to get any run warmup in. I did a few dynamic stretches and hit the starting gate.\n\nDrank a Pedialyte Sport and ate a bagel and a half about 90-120 mins pre race. Espresso Love Gu 20 mins pre race.\n\n##Race\n\n[Visual version here](https://i.imgur.com/VdL7vko.png).\n\nThe course was pretty damn flat. There was a very slight hill that you hit twice leading into Mile 6 and Mile 11, but it was basically a non-issue. I usually train at about 70 feet of vertical gain per mile, so this was a blessing.\n\nMy race plan from my coach was as follows:\n\n* M1-2: 7:28-7:30\n * I executed this perfectly. It was easy to do, as a) that’s a pretty easy pace, and b) the start was CROWDED. I couldn’t have gone much faster without significant weaving, which would have defeated the purpose\n* M3-7: hover in the 7:15 range\n * I did one mile at 7:15. I accidentally did a 7:05 for mile 4, and it felt pretty dang good, so I held it. I knew I was taking a risk, but the day felt good, the course was flatter than my training, and I decided to hold it there for the next few miles. Popped another Espresso Love Gu at Mile 3\n* M8-10: “Press down a bit as you will know at this point what kind of day you are going to have”\n * At this point, I knew 7:00 was possible, but I had to start pushing, as I was averaging about a 7:09 or 7:10. Started cranking. The course was basically dead flat in these miles, with a very small hill leading up to the 11 mile marker. Maurten 160 at Mile 8\n* M11-13.1: “All speed limits off”\n * Played it conservative. 5k can be longer than it seems at the end of the race, and I didn’t want to blow up. Waited until mile 13 to step on it. I regret not starting sooner, as I think I probably had 10-20 seconds left in the tank at the end.\n\n##Assessment\nOverall, this was a great outcome for me. An all time PR, and a solid step on the road to Boston, which is my intermediate goal. A few big takeaways:\n\n* Control my controllables. I showed up late and missed much of my warmup. It was a rookie mistake and who knows how much it affected me\n* Trial my nutrition more ahead of time. The GI issues could have been disastrous. I was lucky I squeezed in 92 minutes without issues. I will experiment with electrolyte drinks more before going into race day like that\n* [Stay in the grey zone. Green zone is injury territory](https://i.imgur.com/4WYxnIx.jpeg).\n\n\n##What’s Next\nHartford Marathon in October. My wife is due mid September, so travel races are out. I’m hoping to shave 10 seconds off my pace and extend it to marathon distance by then, and I’ve got a pretty big training block to work with.\n\nMade with [Strava race report generator](https://race-report-gen.jezl.xyz/).\n\n"

After that race I was so upset with myself for making every rookie mistake (even though I knew NOT to make them), that I immediately signed up for the Fargo full marathon. I also threw my hat into the ring for the Chicago marathon on a lark. Wouldn't you know it, I was selected for Chicago too! So 2 marathons in a year after a dreadful experience with my first marathon.\n\nI did a lot of base building after that race and was running nearly 50 miles (80km) per week. Most of it easy as North Dakota winters leave roads slick at times. I was also playing some indoor soccer at a moderately competitive level. I had not played organized soccer since high school nearly 30 years ago, but I picked it back up very quickly.\n\nDuring a game in early February, on the very first day of my 18 week training plan, I passed the ball to a teammate and immediately felt like I had kicked myself in the back of the leg causing a severe cramping feeling. I hopped off the field and started massaging the cramp to get it to go away which it never seemed to do. After about 10 minutes I tried to walk on it to see if I could walk off the cramp. I couldn't put any weight on that leg without searing pain. I had a very bad suspicion that I had torn my Achilles tendon based on stories I had read not 1 month previous.\n\nThe next day, a doctor confirmed that I had a partial tear of my Achilles and required me to wear a walking boot all day for 3 weeks, start physical training after 1 week, and no running for about 8 weeks. Uff-dah. I was very motivated to get back to running, so I followed the advice of the doctors and physical trainer as close to perfectly as I could. A checkup at week 6 from both the doctor and the PT showed that I had healed really well and at 8 weeks could, in fact, go back to running as long as I was careful and listened to my body. This left me with 8 weeks to train for a marathon where most of those weeks would be rebuilding my base.\n\nInstead of stressing on how I could manage to fit 18 weeks of training into about 4-5 weeks, I decided to drop to the half marathon and just use it as another training day. I was, however, surprised at how quickly I was able to build back my running. The first week I managed 9 miles all on a treadmill. The next week I upped the mileage to 20 with no issues from the calf. 2 weeks later I was up to 30 miles and feeling good until I tried the new shoes I had purchased prior to the injury. The new shoes caused my gait to be different and I was landing more forefoot than midfoot/heel strike and that caused my calves to be engaged a LOT more on this 5 mile run. Afterwards the injury location was not happy. I wasn't in pain, but that area was definitely complaining. I took the rest of that week off (the week before the race).\n\nRace week I managed 3 runs totaling 15 miles and felt good until Thursday night when I felt like I was coming down with something. Taking preventative measures to help stave off any illness may have helped. If things had progressed I would have avoided the race so as not to infect anybody else. Thankfully any symptoms I was feeling went away by Friday evening (race eve).\n\n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nThe race is not near my hometown so I traveled to Fargo and stayed with a friend who lives about 15 minutes away from the venue.This is very convenient and incredibly helpful as I get a nice bed to sleep in without the costs of the hotel.\n\nPre race was nothing special. Carb loading throughout the week (lots of pasta or rice) capped with some nice ravioli the night before at a restaurant. Interestingly enough, I sat next to and talked a bit with the man that ultimately won the full marathon. So that was cool.\n\nAfter returning from the restaurant I got back to my friend's house and started laying out my race day kit and realized I had neglected to bring my SPI-belt which I use to carry my phone. I prefer to listen to audiobooks while running. A long drive back to my house just to fetch this belt was not an option so I chose to run without the phone/earbuds. I figured this would be fine as last year I only managed to hear about 10-15 minutes of my book during the run anyway.\n\nUp at 4am on race day to take care of the necessary bodily obligations as well as give me a chance to eat something and start pre-hydrating. I wanted to leave the house by 5am so I could arrive at the venue by 5:30 or 6am at the latest (I wasn't sure how bad traffic/parking would be). It turns out that being that early was probably overkill, but there was literally no stress and I got a great parking space.\n\n### Race\n\nAs the sun hadn't quite crested the horizon it was a little chilly standing outside in light wind (for Fargo) and 50F. I brisk walk around the Fargodome and around the starting corral area helped me warm up a little bit. I met a friend who was running the full and we chatted a bit. I'm glad we did as he hadn't paid attention to the myriad of emails sent out the 2 days prior to the race indicating that race times had been adjusted.\n\nThe call came to head to the starting corral about 20-30 minutes before the actual race began. This was probably necessary with over 3200 people and little to no volunteers/staff to actually organize us. Since my training had not been great, but I was still feeling pretty good, I was hoping to hit about 1:50 so I found the pacer for that group and lined up near her.\n\nWith a small speech by the emcee commemorating the tragic death of the race organizer less than a year ago, the national anthems of Canada and USA, the race began.\n\nMiles 1-5:\n\nI was prepared for the pacers to shoot out too fast as that is what had happened the previous year. This year was no exception. Much of the first half mile was spent almost 1 min/mile faster than pace which should be around 8:23/mile for a 1:50 finish. This was corrected after someone else came up and chatted with the pacer. It turns out this person was someone who had paced races before and was trying to be helpful??? Miles 2 and 3 were also a little fast, but not by much. I was feeling pretty good, so I edged my pace up a little bit, or so I though. It turns out that I was running about the same pace while the pacer adjusted her pace to the more appropriate splits. Occasionally I would run with someone and chat with them, other times I was just running near others. Crowd support in this portion of the race is a little thin, but I don't expect huge crowds at 7:30am.\n\nMiles 6-10:\n\nThis section of the race was more of the same. I was running what felt right but would check my watch occasionally to ensure I wasn't slipping too fast or too slow although I felt like I was running faster than I should have been. I kept thinking that I might actually catch the 1:45 if I kept my paces in the low 8's /mile. (SPOILER: I didn't). I noticed in this section of the race that my watch was marking off the miles quite a bit differently than was marked on the course. There is no GPS issues in/around Fargo as there is not much in the way of tall buildings ANYWHERE!!!! While this course is VERY flat, as most of eastern ND is extraordinarily flat, the course makers did manage to find the ONE hill in Fargo. Thankfully it was down the steeper slope while the climb back up was much more gradual. In fact, the only real elevation there is for this race is encountered during the underpasses (train/highway).\n\nMiles 10-13.1\n\nThese miles were a bit rougher. I hit the 10 mile mark and said out loud ONLY 5K to go! I don't know if this helped as this was the time I started having to put effort into the running. The previous miles just seemed to melt away nicely. These ones took more concentration. It is around mile 11 the course combines with the 10k course and the slower runners. There was never an issue with running lanes as we were all spread out enough to allow any faster runners a clear pathway through. The issues is that the slower runners/walkers affect me more psychologically. My pace dipped in mile 12 and that was the hardest mile of the entire race. For the last mile (and a third) I could see the finish line. I told you Fargo was flat. It was deceptively far. I started increasing my pace which helped bring my 13th mile back to my previous race pace and slightly faster. The third of a mile (the race was .2 miles long according to my watch) I started giving everything I had left in the tank. I crossed the finish line 1:48:50. I was happy, tired, and a little sore.\n\n### Post-race\n\nI got my medal, and post race treats which included the greenest banana I have ever seen...and I am red/green colorblind! I couldn't even peel the thing, so I threw it in the trash and grabbed some other snacks before exiting the finish line corral. I watched other finishers for a while and did some stretching before getting back to my car to inform my wife that I finished and what my time was since she was not able to come with me for this race.\n\nOverall I was very pleased with my performance. My splits were all so close, but I wasn't really pushing the pace either due to the injury recovery. I was pleased with the VERY slightly negative split in this race.\n\nNow to rest a bit this week then start my training plan next week for the Chicago full marathon!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

The training went pretty well, I began figuring out how HR zones work and linking them to expected times, the weekly mileage ramped up slowly and was tolerated fairly well. Once mileage hit 65+ kms per week (40mi) I noticed a few niggling injuries beginning to appear, but these were handled pretty well with self-massage, and starting ATG strength training for my knees and calves. The biggest run in this training block was a 3hr effort, with 8kms at marathon goal pace (5:01/km, 8:04/mi), the last 2kms of that marathon pace effort being up a very steep incline. I arrived home after that run with very sore feet, and consequently the volume in the next week suffered. Due to a busy schedule, I missed some key runs, especially long runs and a few threshold sessions that I feel negatively impacted my race-day performance.\n\nAbout a week out from the race, I started to feel a bit sick, but put it out of my mind and pushed through training, which was a bad idea, as that sickness continued to get worse the week of the race, only allowing 11kms total to be run that week, and keeping me couch-bound and off work for a few days. I rocked up to the race feeling average at best, and in retrospect I probably had a little bit of COVID due to my symptoms.\n\nMy nutrition was up-and-down the whole training cycle, trying to figure out what worked for me and how much to eat, leading to weeks of overeating, and some weeks of undereating.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI began carb-loading the day before the marathon, however last-minute preparations got in the way of consistent food throughout the day, and I really only started eating a decent amount around lunchtime, or about 16 hours out from the race. My diet changed significantly to achieve this, and I woke up feeling deflated and drowsy the morning of the race.\n\nImmediately pre-race, I warmed up for about 400m, and did some static stretching and dynamic movements. At this point, I noticed my HR was significantly higher than it should have been, which would be a sign of things to come.\n\n# Race\n\nI started the race at a pace I was fairly happy with, however my HR was 10-20BPM higher than it usually is at those efforts, which I put down to nerves and figured it would eventually even out. By 20mins in, I realised this probably wasn't going to happen, and ended up running all of the uphill sections at threshold effort (but far below threshold pace), but figured I'd just tough it through and keep going. How bad could it get?\n\nBy the 10km mark I was feeling good, starting to smash uphills and felt nice and cruisy at almost marathon-pace along the flats. I was overtaking people and running strong, found my stride, and focused on maintaining good leg turnover and running tall. By the time I'd hit K 18, I wasn't feeling amazing, had a brief bout of light-headedness and slowed my pace slightly and tried to relax as much as possible. That passed, and I finished the first half of the race feeling strong.\n\nAs I turned around for lap 2, the first hill out of the city was feeling ok, but the enormity of how much race I had left and how I was feeling was beginning to dawn on me. I accidentally consumed some of the provided electrolyte drink instead of water, and about 5 minutes after that my guts started having a very bad time. I never got rid of this, and the stomach cramps stuck with me until the end of the race. Continued at the same effort through all the big hills, and hit K 24 feeling pretty decent. I'd been fuelling properly the whole time, aiming for 90g carbs/hour and about 1000ml of water in the same time, plus I'd been using my salt tabs, however K 25 was harder, 26 even harder, and so on and so forth. My left hamstring started to cramp up bad, and I had to alter my running form to prevent this from being any more of an issue than it already was. By 30kms in, I knew I was done for, knew I'd blown it on any of my goals by going out too hard, and realised that my lot in life for the next hour or so was to suffer. So be it. I spent about 8 minutes total having a walk, trying to clear the lactate out of my system and find a second wind, but it never came. Finally crossing that finish line well short of my goal was one of the best feelings I've had. Very happy to have finished the race.\n\n# Post-race\n\nThe missus and her family came to support me, gave me a whole bunch of fruit and sports drinks but I wanted none of, just feeling absolutely burned out. But was very thankful to have people there to hobble back to the car with, and spent the remainder of the day resting pretty hard.\n\n# What's Next?\n\nI learned a lot this marathon, and I'm glad to have the experience of the next on on-board to be much better prepared for my next one. My biggest and most unexpected lesson? Don't run a marathon as a 90kg man in Altra Escalante Racers. They might do it for people without any weight, but man oh man were my legs and feet absolutely stinging! Going out to invest in some better running shoes immediately, and very keen to put all my lessons learned into my next marathon. Pfitz 18/55 is the plan I'm going to try next, after a few weeks of very light walking and running, and catching up with all the mates I haven't seen for the last 16 weeks because of my training.\n\nIf anyone has anything to add, or some tips for me, I'm all ears.\n\nCheers!"

As I'm not a big fan of training by intensity zone, I agreed with the trainer who would complement the training using VDOT as a basis for training. And I can already say that it was great to have a rhythm base to do the training.  \nBasically the training lasted just under 12 weeks, with a 10km trail race in the middle of the 12 weeks. I had a lot of track training with 400m, 600m, 1000m and 1500m sprints, but nothing more than that where longer sprint training was very rare and varied between 400m and 600m sprints. I also had a lot of 1:1, 1:500m fartleks. I usually did them on the street, even in sections with very low elevations, with few climbs and descents.  \nNow comes the very peculiar part of the training, the long runs were not as long as expected. The vast majority of long training sessions were around 12km or 16km and only one training session reached 18km and that was extremely light. Although the long training sessions were not long, most of them turned into a rhythmic one, where they basically started with a light pace and ended with 4 or 5km above the race pace.  \nAnother important point, along with running training, I also do specific strengthening for running 3 times a week and 3 more running training sessions during the week with one day of rest.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe pre-race was the basics with a week of polishing with very light training, just to keep the body trained for the race. There were two very light workouts, one of just 6km and the other a light ride of 40min.  \nOne thing I always do in the last pre-race training along with the light training is to include strides training at the end of the run, with a maximum of 4 sprints of 20 seconds. I don't know if it has any effect on polishing, particularly I end up feeling good before the race, a bit with that feeling of duty accomplished and that I'm ready for the race.  \nAs for food, during the week of the race I increased my carbohydrate intake a little and the day before my meals were high in carbohydrates, basically including pasta and bread. Regarding hydration, the day before I increased the amount of liquids a little and as I didn't do very well doing the sodium bicarbonate regimen, I replaced it with a lot of sparkling water, I practically spent the day before the test drinking only sparkling water.  \nAnother not very important point, as I live about 250km from SP, I had to drive the day before to São Paulo, arriving around lunchtime to collect my kit and check in at the hotel.\n\n# Race\n\nOn the day of the race there is all that chaos before getting to the start. I woke up around 3:30 am and surprisingly, I slept really well, as I usually lose sleep due to pre-race anxiety. Then it was the rush to have breakfast and here the hotel helped a lot by managing to make advances for guests who were going to the race and then ordering a car via app until the start.  \nThe weather forecast had already said that it would be cold and rainy on Sunday, I just didn't really believe that it would be very cold and rainy right at the start of the race. And so we started in the rain, which lasted until the 3rd km and after that it was just great weather for running.  \nTalking about my performance in the race, I didn't have much faith that I would be able to do a good pace due to the training and I left thinking that I needed a few long training sessions to feel more prepared. This all proved to be a big mistake and it was worth believing in the process and doing what had to be done during training.  \nI didn't think of any very fancy strategies for the race, like doing a negative sprint from X km onwards. I just wanted to maintain the same pace throughout the race and although at times I was a little above 4:20/km I managed to control it very well, managing to accelerate and slow down when necessary. Looking at the splits I don't know what I did in the 7th km when I lost control of my pace but I soon managed to correct it.  \nFrom km 18 until the end I did it with one foot of my shoe untied, this never happened in training and I believe that the rain must have influenced this to happen. This ended up being a bit annoying in the last 4 kilometers where I was afraid of tripping over the laces and the sneakers started to feel loose on my feet. I was unable to do a negative sprint, losing just over 15 seconds. I also didn't want to stop to tie up for fear of losing my good pace and not being able to recover until the end of the race.  \nIn total, I took two carbohydrate gels at km 7 and 14, which was approximately one every 30 minutes and even with the cold weather and rain I took water at all hydration points, just to wet my mouth and pour some on my head - to cool the body hahaha... In the race there were some points with isotonic drinks and cold coke (I didn't see that one), but I didn't even go through them and just completed it with gel and water.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI finished the race with the feeling that I didn't need to be conservative with my pace and could manage between 4:15 and 4:18 per kilometer. I ended up doing it at a more comfortable pace because in the last half I did I ended up breaking at kilometer 14.  \nAfter finishing the race, I didn't stay in the event arena due to the cold and rain that returned and I “ran” to the hotel to take a hot shower and rest my legs a bit before hitting the road back home.  \nThe post-race meal at lunch was a dish - very generous - of rice, beans and plenty of potatoes to replace the calories lost during the race and lots of water.  \nThe training in this week consisted of two very light regenerative sessions, one 6km and the other 9km + 1km sprint. The kilometer sprint started in good time but my legs still aren't responding very well and at the weekend I'm going to do a long run, very light workout. With the strengthening workouts I did them normally, just reducing the load to let the legs recover. Since if I stayed still all week I believe it would be much worse."

        "Texto": "Pittsburgh Marathon 2024 Race Report\n\nDate May 5th 2024a\n\nDistance 26.2\n\nOfficial Time 3:10:52\n\nStrava: [https://www.strava.com/athletes/105616617](https://www.strava.com/athletes/105616617)\n\n \n\nTraining\n\nI started my build up for this race the week of Thanksgiving 2023. I built up coming off the Harrisburg Marathon with weeks of 20,30, and 40 miles before I started adding 10% each week.  I decided to run Jack Daniels 2Q program as I liked the flexibility of the workouts which fit in great with my family’s hectic schedule which now included 2 girls under 2 years, my first semester of nursing school while concurrently working 30 hours a week. At the end of January I was experiencing some lower tibial pain. I decided to stop running entirely for a week after coming off my then highest volume week ever of 57 miles. This ended up being a great decision. I scaled back up pretty quickly and didn’t miss any other 2Q workouts and it never flared up. I think running on the road/snow in trail shoes after a snowstorm caused it.\n\nI averaged 50-60 miles for the majority of the block which was about 15-20 miles more per week than my Fall buildup\n\nI had two key workouts that really gave me confidence going into the race. The first was a repeat of a route that I did in my fall prep except I went from 20miles at a 8:40 pace to 22 miles at a 7:39 pace that included a 6:45 last mile where I pushed because I felt like I had gas in the tank. The second was my last long run before tapering. This was a 19 miler that featured 1350 feet of vertical gain which is substantially more than the entirety of the Pittsburgh Marathon course. Average pace was 8:05 which was a bit slower than I wanted but elevation was brutal. At the time, I honestly thought to myself that I am an idiot and I should’ve picked a flatter route because this didn’t really give me confidence going into the taper….\n\n \n\nPre-Race\n\nI said this in last year’s report for Pittsburgh and it bears repeating… 10/10 organization and race experience. Plenty of bathrooms, quick and easy gear check, easy access to corrals, such a relaxed pre-race experience. The only stressful part of this morning was coordinating a photo with a group of other local runners for a pre-race picture. Ironically, I was the one who suggested the meeting area and I was the only one who went to the wrong spot.\n\n \n\nRace\n\nRace strategy coming into the race was to run 7:15 pace and shoot for a 3:10 and get as close to a even split as possible.\n\nMiles 1-11\n\nOne of my favorite things about the half and full in Pittsburgh is that they set of fireworks that go off right after the gun start and are staggered for each corral. My wife ran the half and this was a major selling point to her. I love how the excitement isn’t reserved for just the first corral. The first 11 miles are flat or rolling as you go up and down a few bridges. During this period I clocked miles between 7:07 and 7:15. For all of training and race day, I went with Tailwind powder for my nutrition. I absolutely LOVE it. I was concerned that carrying 2-750 ml soft flasks in my flip belt with 3 scoops (scoop has 25 carbs) would be annoying and cumbersome but throughout training I found it wasn’t that annoying and I felt super well fueled and hydrated throughout my training runs. I took roughly 1/3 of the flasks every 3.5 miles.\n\nMiles 12-14\n\nThe part that everyone talks and fears about racing in Pittsburgh… Birmingham Bridge and Forbes Ave. Last year I picked a hill nearby that simulated the Birmingham Bridge and strategically placed it at the end of my long runs. This year I went a step further and had hilly routes for 90% of both my easy runs and my 2Q workouts. This paid off BIG. Going into the race I told myself to not burn my candle out in this stretch and be ok with 8min or 8:15min miles. I ended up running 7:26, 7:31, and 7:16 for miles 12,13, and 14 which featured 41,102, and 43 feet of vertical gain. I did moderate the effort on the inclines but I think this was a spot where the carb loading paid off from a power production standpoint. I also think my final key workout that I deemed “too hilly” paid off. I was feeling really good here and there was a small group of people midway up Forbes Avenue and I turned to them, made a eating with a spoon gesture and said “I eat hills for breakfast”\n\n \n\nMiles 15-19\n\nThis part of the course was a little bit quieter but I enjoyed running through parts of the city that I hadn’t previously experienced the year prior. At about this time I started to notice that there was a particular spectator who was showing up solo at various points of the race with a small sauté pan and wooden spoon to cheer people on. I didn’t see any bicycle so not sure how he was getting from point to point so quickly. Miles between 7:07 and 7:28.\n\n \n\nMile 20\n\nMile 20 features the highest point on the course, the last substantial incline and signals a steady decline to the finish. It was around this point that I was starting to feel the effort become more difficult. I had music on the entire race and I paused it for about 20 seconds. I had forgotten that someone I run with weekly was coincidentally going to be in Pittsburgh visiting a friend. Luckily my music was off because I heard him say my name and cheer me on and that gave me quite a boost when I needed it most. Clocked my slowest mile here 7:39. The Pan man showed up 2 more times in this stretch.\n\n \n\nMiles 21-26 Race #2\n\nThe mental boost from my buddy really helped me reset and I realized that I actually felt pretty good for being 20+ miles into a marathon. At this point the wall hits a lot of people but I never ran into that issue. Shoutout yet again to Featherstone Nutrition on IG. I followed her carb loading calculator as always and I am not 3/3 on not bonking nor really hitting a wall in my marathons. The Pan Man made another appearance and I said to him “ you are f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* everywhere”. His last appearance was around mile 25 and he seemed to be with a group of friends at this point so this time I said “Hot damn it’s the man with the pan!” They thought it was funny, I thought it was funny, my wife when I told her did not think it was funny.\n\nI was clocking miles at 7:15 or better at this point. I was slowly running people down 1 by 1 as I was surging at a time when others struggled. This was mentally boosting for me and I grinded out my fastest mile at 6:57 at mile 24 which had a major elevation drop of -175ft. Mile 25 7:21. Mile 26 7:08.\n\nThe Finish 26-26.4\n\nI unfortunately did not run a perfect course (who ever does lol) so my finish was .4 miles according to my watch. I clocked a 6:07 pace with a top pace of 5:16. The finishing stretch was super crowded as the half and full marathon course came back together. I had to weave a bit but finished strong and on my feet. Crossed the line with an official time of 3:10:52 which was almost exactly a 10 min PR from the Harrisburg Marathon which is nearly pancake flat.\n\n \n\nPost- Race\n\nThe finish line feeling is what I train for. The feeling of all the hard work paying off. All of the many early morning runs in the dark, the below freezing temperatures (including some in single digits) and lifting 3x a week with a heavy leg day weekly. I steadily climbed from 238^(th) place to 181^(st) by the finish jumping 25 places in the last 10k. I was patient and executed my plan to perfection, all while having the most fun throughout the race than I ever had.\n\nI am constantly driven by me desire to find my true potential because I have already surpassed what I thought my potential was when I started my running journey Aug of 2022. Next up for me is Philly 2024 Marathon where the goal is to BQ (sub 3 hrs). Realistically, this won’t actually qualify me a spot in Boston 2026 because of even faster cutoff times.\n\n \n\nPittsburgh has been an absolute joy to run in so maybe Pittsburgh 2025 we run it back and truly punch my ticket to Boston?\n\n "

At the time, I had little knowledge to properly train for a marathon and felt that I could deliver better results with a proper training block. Took a couple of months off running, due to school, but begun to train by the start of 2024. \n\nOne of my new year resolutions was to start running with others, where I joined Blacktoe Running for their Sunday long runs. These long runs consisted 25-30km+, with a deload week every month & made running more enjoyable towards the end of the week. These long runs were complemented with a couple of easy runs + one medium speed workout each week for 18 weeks (2 weeks of taper). Luckily, I was able to include marathon pacing into a few long runs, which I had not included into prior training. Total mileage increased monthly from 195km(**Jan**), 319km(**Feb**), 381km(**Mar**), 354km(**Apr**), 240km (**May**). Weekly mileage averaged to about \\~80-85km before the taper with a peak week of 105km.\n\nFortunately, I had the time to maintain strength training  with one lower body session per week. This consisted with a mix of squats, deadlifts, bulgarian split squats, RDL's, calf raises, monster walks, etc. \n\nShoe rotation consisted of **Nike Zoomfly 5's** for easy/recovery runs, **Adidas Boston 12's** for easy/tempo/long runs, and the **Nike Vaporfly 2's** (that I thrifted for $60 new) for long runs in later weeks. Also, decided to use the **Alphafly 2's** after putting in 80km and unfortunately having to cut part of the insole to avoid the notorious arch blisters that most runners experience. \n\nNutrition consisted of Maurten 100/160's and fast chews during long runs, and Liquid IV for hydration before and during runs. However, I tried to avoid excessively using gels with how expensive they are.\n\nI had only raced one 10k during this build with a **40:4X** finish, 2 weeks out from the marathon. This led me to believe that I was able to run a 3:20-3:30 marathon. At the beginning of May, I started to get accustomed to waking up at 5am ,as there were multiple weeks of hot & humid temperatures leading up to the race. \n\n# Pre-race\n\nArrived in Ottawa on Friday and ran a final 6k shakeout run, and picked up my bib on Saturday. The expo experience was fine, and thankfully did not end up spending any money. Unfortunately, I signed up for a shakeout run, however I was unable to attend, due to poor scheduling on my part of attending the expo first. Sometimes less is more, so it wasn't a huge deal breaker. I had carb loaded 3 days prior consisting of overnight oats, bagels, pasta, and pizza. I did not get good sleep during the week with  4-6hr/avg. \n\nOne of my friends/teammates(**will refer him as M**) that I trained with since the start of this year, decided to stay with me Saturday evening & travel to the start line together. We both verbally agreed to try to stay beside each other for a long as possible, but would move on forward if one of us bonked later on. It was a special race for him as this was his first ever marathon.\n\nWoke up at 4:00am, consumed a bagel with peanut butter & a banana, and drank one cup of coffee and 500ml of water mixed with Liquid IV. Put on my race kit & got dropped off to the starting line. I did feel that I would be a tad over hydrated and had to use the washroom multiple times before the race. \n\nFor nutrition, I brought 4 Maurten 100's & 4 GO Gels to be taken every 30 minutes, and 21 salt chews to be taken every 40 min or when my legs started to cramp. \n\nThe weather at the start was pleasant, at about 14 degrees with overcast for most of the race.\n\nThe first gel was taken 15 min prior to start time, and lined up just behind the 3:20 and 3:25 pace bunnies. After a delay and the elites set off, the 2nd wave started around 7:15am. \n\n# Race\n\n**1-5K**\n\nAs with most big marathons, the 1st km was very congested and tried to avoid weaving as much as possible. M & I agreed to start the race conservatively at a strict 4:50/km pace for the first 10-16km, and quickly got settled in. Unfortunately, I had a creeping urge to pee early on and followed what others did by running towards a bush \\*oops sorry\\* around the 5k mark. \n\n**5-15k**\n\nMuch of this time was playing catch up to M, as he was just 200m ahead. The farm area was actually pleasant & 1st time around to see the other runners, which was definitely motivating to know that 3:20 was within reach after passing the 3:25 pace group. At this point, I was going 10-15sec faster than what was planned, but was fairly flat & downhill. As I finally caught up with M, he decided to push the pace and lost him for the 2nd time.\n\n**16-25k**\n\nMan, this part of the race was electric. There were crowd support on both sides of the road and running past parliament hill was probably one of the highlights. Every minute I heard someone scream 'GO BLACKTOE\" to my surprise, and evidently helped with my fastest splits during this period. Again, I caught up with M & we crossed the half together by pumping up the crowd.\n\n**26-32k**\n\nThis was when I started to feel both of my VMO's cramp, and started to panic. I ended up taking 9 fast chews within a 20 min period, which which somewhat help to not fully seize and bonk. Also, it did not help seeing the other runners faces & form starting to struggle on the  Rockcliffe Parkway as they reached the 30k point. Unfortunately, this was when I dropped and last saw M, as he was experiencing pain in both legs. This was also the closest point to the 3:20 pace group as they turned back into the Rockcliffe.\n\n**33-37k**\n\nThose Rockcliffe hills were brutal. I started to have doubts if I could sustain my pace and the thought of running a sub 3:20 was slipping away. My quads were pounding & it was all a mental game. I was glad with all of the crowd support that still helped me push through.\n\n**38-Finish** \n\nAs we left Rockcliffe, the crowd support started to increase again. I just told myself \"release all you have left in the tank\". However, it was not enough time to recover & around 39km was when the half marathon runners merged together. It was very difficult to have to weave again for the last couple of km & thats when the sun decided to show up. I looked down towards my watch with 2km left, having run 3:12:XX. The last 2km felt the longest stretch of the whole marathon, but I got to soak it all in with both my hands high and on both my feet.\n\n# Post-race\n\nImmediately stopped my watch and saw 42.72km, which was very surprising. I guess I spent those extra 500m weaving. I walked over to the hydration station and drank about 8 cups of water. I waited about 10 minutes for M, but after seeing the 2:00 & 2:15 half marathon pacers, I felt that something had happened. I decided to get my medal and meet up with him post race when I got a call from the medical staff that he had to be wheel chaired off, once he crossed the finish line. \n\nAfter half an hour, I was able to reach him where medical staff had been helping participants. We hugged each other as it was a special moment for having just run his first marathon. We were instructed to walk for awhile before he could be discharged & received his medal afterwards.\n\nWe met up with my family afterwards and ate AYCE sushi as a celebration for what was an amazing weekend in Ottawa. I would definitely recommend this spring race as an experience, although its notoriously known to be called \"Hottawa\". The weather conditions were actually decent compared to previous years, although it did get very warm towards the finish. It was well organized & the crowd support did not disappoint at all. Ended up with a 35min PB and will look to build upon this going into the summer/fall. \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

Marathon was my last try to hit my totally arbitrary and made up goal of achieving 3 hours before turning 40 later this year. I had a disappointing fall marathon last year where I missed 6 weeks of peak training due to injury and questioned whether I would run it or not - a 3:20:21. Not only was I not properly trained, I also ran the first half like doorknob and crashed and burned through the last 10k with more walking than I'd like to admit.\n\n**Training**\n\nI started ramping back up after my fall race in November.  I spent weeks building mileage to get going in a modified Pfitz 18/70. I was comfortably putting in 100km weeks and eager to get going. Winter in Saskatchewan is bitter and can be brutal.  Lots of snowy and windy runs through the winter, with quite a few at an indoor track or on the treadmill when it got REALLY bad outside.\n\nI pushed long runs further than Pfitz called for, because I knew I needed more time spent closer to marathon distance.  Leg strength and endurance were always my limiting factors. I also adjusted some of the shorter workout days to incorporate some structured speed in the mid week long runs.  My favourite being the \"superset\" that a friend introduced me to - 3x 3k @ MP, 2k @ half pace, 1k @ threshold with 1k rest between.  Did that a couple times and boy did it make my confidence soar.\n\n**Injury Again!**\n\nI could feel the beginning of the same injury that sidelined me in the summer coming on again after I pushed myself far too hard over a 3 week period in March. 2 back to back 130 km weeks with far too many hard days and not enough recovery pushed me in to overuse. Back to the Chriopractor/Physio. Tendonitis!\n\n**Managing**\n\nI spent the next 2 months managing the pain and modifying workouts to basically maintain all of the fitness gains I had made.  Some days I felt good, some days I felt bad.  I took longer to recover from sessions and had to plan accordingly.  Rest was a huge priority. I had to get to the start line relatively healthy and I knew I had a good shot at achieving my goal. Bi-weekly massage and chiro visits while focusing more on strength (which I admittedly slacked off on through the buildup to injury) and targeted exercises discussed with my health team.\n\n**Tune-ups**\n\nI was able to get in 2 tune-up races in the weeks leading up to the marathon. I ran a 1:22:28 half marathon about 4 weeks out and a 37:44 10k 2 weeks out.  Both of those were windy days, but definitely showed that I had the goods to deliver on race day. Both of those were PRs by a significant margin. The 10k left me reeling though.  I had to take a few days completely off and it felt like I may have cooked my chances at running the marathon. To say I was spiralling mentally would be an understatement. By the weekend, I was feeling well enough to put in some very easy miles. I spent the last week before the marathon running recovery paced runs with only one set of 6 strides on Friday. Everything felt OK, so the race was a go.\n\n**I am Carbs**\n\nStarted taking in an attempted 600g of carbs per day Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  I never drink juice, but I took down all the mango juice I could to supplement the oatmeal, bagels and pasta. And cake. I eat cake to help reach my carb goals!\n\n**Race Day**\n\nI drove up to Saskatoon the day before the race, grabbed my race kit and took a real easy shake out.  Sat in the hot tub at the hotel for a few minutes while the kids enjoyed the pool and hot tub. Ate some cajun chicken fettuccine alfredo, had some water and off to bed nice and early.\n\nUp at 3:30 to get my pre-race meal in of oatmeal and coffee. Back to bed where I laid awake, but resting, until 5:00. The race was at 7:00, but I wanted to be there for 6:00 to avoid traffic (perks of a smaller race, can drive there and don't have to be too early). Got there bang on 6:00.  Hit the portapotties and got started on a very light 2km job.  Did my usual drills and warmup routine as more and more people showed up. I take my first gel 15 minutes before start time. Said good bye to my wife and kids and got in to the corral, as near to the front as I could get.\n\nI started chatting with people around me to find other people with similar goals and quickly found a few and was happy I wouldn't be running on my own (smaller race and all).\n\n**The Race**\n\nWeather was fantastic. Overcast, cool and cloudy start with sun coming through around the half point.  Winds were reasonable (for Saskatchewan, iykyk)\n\nRace start wasn't too congested since I had managed to get myself in a good position. 4:07 for the first km, a little hot but definitely not outrageous for the start.  Time to relax and dial in my pace.  Aim for 4:12-4:15s - that's the goal.  Keep it easy and even and pick up later if you can. Early on there's a substantial downhill at km #4 and clocked in at 3:58 for that kilometer.  Acceptable, but don't get carried away after that.  5km - 20:39. A little fast, but we had that faster km in there so just relax.  I skipped the first aid station as there were still quite a few runners around me (half and full together) but hit every other station for water. Fuel was going to be a SIS Beta Fuel every 7km. Just under 80g of carbs per hour. I had practised this through training and it worked for me.\n\n10k rolls by in 41:36. At this point we've got a group of 4 guys running together. 3 full marathon runners and a half runner. I'm feeling really good, definitely not pushing the pace or exerting myself too hard. Lots of chatting going on at this point, a good sign for sure!\n\n15k - 1:02:35 We're keeping ourselves accountable to the pace in the group. Still chatting away. Around 18k the half runner splits off and we wish him good luck on his 1:30 goal.  I hope he got it, he had a nice cushion but a 20m uphill at 20km - something for me to look forward to around 41k.\n\n21.1k - 1:28:41 Looking good.  I've got a small cushion if things go sideways in the back half.  Still feeling pretty loose and good at this point.  Chatting away still, but shortly after half we lose one of the pack. 2 of us remain.\n\n30k - 2:05:13 Feeling pretty good for having run 30k so far.  My calves are starting to feel a little tight and I'm drinking half the water and pouring the other half on myself at aid stations as the weather warms up. The course undulates a fair bit going up and down along the river, a really beautiful course.\n\n35k - 2:25:57 We've actually slightly picked up the pace. My new friend and I are no longer as chatty as we were in the beginning. Things are starting to feel tight and get hard.  This is what all the early mornings, snowy and windy training runs and early nights were for.  Something a good friend told me is that when things get hard you drop to your training. I have a framed picture in my kids' room that says \"You Can Do Hard Things\" and I kept thinking about that.\n\n40k - 2:46:47 Why do we run marathons again? Just a couple more km, you can do this! My friend had a little bit more in the tank than I did at this point and he got about a 100m lead on me. Remember that uphill I mentioned earlier? It's time. 4:25 for that km.  Ouch. I get to the top of that hill and can hear the speakers from the finish line. So close now!\n\n42.4k(damn tangents!) - 2:56:58. I did it!  I broke 3 hours!  Hell, I broke 2:57! A huge smile on my face as I crossed the line.  I found my running partner for the race after getting my medal and we went to ring our PR bell together and get a great picture as we both helped each other reach that sub-3 mark.  We were both beaming, exchanged information to link up on Strava. What a race!\n\n**Post Race and Thoughts**\n\nGrabbed some food and some drink from the tent and sat down with my family to rest and stretch a little. Feeling sore, but accomplished.\n\nShoes - I won't be wearing the Vaporlys for a marathon again.  They felt fine during the race, but my calves and cooked. Day after and I'm struggling to move around. My arch-nemesis, stairs, is back to haunt me  Luckily I have a massage scheduled for this afternoon.\n\nRehab - I will be taking some time off after this to recover from this tendinitis properly.  Physio booked for later this week to get rolling on a proper recovery plan.\n\nTraining - I'm hiring a coach for the summer build for a fall marathon. I need an outside perspective to keep me from pushing to overuse and hurting myself again.\n\nNext Goal - 2:52. Buckle up!\n\nIf you lasted this long, thanks for reading! It's nice to put this all down in writing to reflect on the race and the preparation. I'm proud of the effort I put in and the result I got.  This was my first properly executed race, and if we're honest, my first marathon that I didn't walk any portion of it. Cheers!"

        "Texto": "I have been running off and on for a year. I'm 31 years old, 5'7, 167lbs and have been weightlifting/rock climbing for years. I went from barely being able to run 0.25 of a mile to running in 5k races, and a few Spartan Races. However, I kept running into shin splint issue.\n\nI went to a physical therapist who just suggested I was increasing mileage too fast, and said my HOKAs were fine and I was a heel striker. My PT has ran ultra marathons and was very knowledgeable, and he said to check my cadence, slow down on mileage, and gave me several calf/tibialis(?) exercises to do. I was already in a great starting place because I have weight lifted for years, and focus on lower body movements (squats, lunges, deadlifts, glute bridges) appropriately. \n\nMy cadence is 180, I run very slow, but yet any time I run more than a 5k I am plagued with shin splints that will set me back 1-2 weeks. My overall volume is around 7 miles a week (Monday is 2 miles, Wednesday is 2 miles, Friday is 3 miles).\n\nI have tried HOKAs, Brooks Ghost (12mm drop), and just now have switched to a 0 drop shoe (Altra) and ran in those. Yet, my shin splints keep coming back.\n\nI really would love to run a half-marathon, hell, running a 10k would be a dream to me at this point. However, I am set back CONSTANTLY by shin splints and I feel like I have exhausted every possible resource. Is their anyone who had to give up running due to this? I've been loving it, but I'm at a total loss.\n\nEDIT: I meant to say that I had to take 5 months off running due to a fractured foot (because I feel off my porch, nothing running related) so in total I've run about 7 months."

One of our number had already done two halfs and was keen to keep the motivation going; two of us (myself included) had never done one, but were up for the challenge; and one of us was... slightly less convinced, and in fact ended up missing out on a place - possibly deliberately - leaving three of us to tackle the race and training together.\n\nWe had plenty of time (about 9 months), so I decided to set myself an ambitious goal: I wanted to do sub-90. My 5k PB at the time was just over 21 minutes, so it felt like sub-90 would be a stretch, but could be achievable if training went according to plan.\n\nMy dad (65) has also got into running since the pandemic, and decided he'd like to join; my mum (60), also a pandemic runner, opted for the 10k the day before.\n\n# Training\n\nI'm allergic to complicated training plans, so I did some reading and decided to follow a super simple \"plan\": start from a manageable weekly mileage, and increase by \\~10% each week, building a solid base up to 70-80km per week. I'd add in weekly long runs up to a third of weekly mileage (less in the latter stages), and threshold / tempo efforts later in the plan to build speed and make sure I'd be able to maintain the pace.\n\nIt was going fairly well for the most part, with only very minor niggles up until December/January time, and I successfully made it to 50km/week. Unfortunately, I pushed it on a long run: despite feeling good on the run itself, I ended up with some minor ankle pain, which a 5km recovery run turned into pretty significant pain. I spoke to a physio, who diagnosed it as tendonitis - thankfully not the stress fracture I'd feared, but it stopped me from running entirely for 3 weeks, and my efforts to build back up were continually scuppered by an assortment of emergent minor injuries. Since February, I've only been able to max out at \\~30km per week - usually much less - and my first run over 10km was a 17km long run last Friday, 9 days before the race. I took it slow on this run, and while it probably wasn't the best idea from a physical conditioning perspective, mentally I needed it to know that I could still handle the distance.\n\nAs to why I hadn't managed a longer training run before then, I don't really have a satisfactory answer. In part, I think I just kept setting off too fast and pushing it, which my body wasn't equipped to handle. I think I also (stupidly) had my shoes laced too tight, which was giving me arch pain; loosening them resolved this issue entirely, which was a minor miracle at this stage!\n\nClearly, sub-90 was way out of reach by this stage - frankly, even if I'd been able to train consistently throughout, it would have still been a struggle. I settled on just making it round in under two hours, and aiming to beat my dad if possible. It was looking pretty ropey for one of my friends, too: he'd encountered myriad issues, from a slipped disk to a sore knee. The other one - the only one of us who was new to running! - had nailed every run in his plan, and was going to make it round no problem, although we didn't have much of a sense of how fast he'd be.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI figured I'd used up my luck on the 17km training run, so decided to \"taper\" properly by taking the rest of the time off until the race itself. I think it's fair to say I nailed... basically zero elements of race prep. Anxiety (both race-related and unrelated) meant my nutrition was terrible - I barely managed a proper meal in the three days leading up to the race. My sleep was also not great; I got about 5 hours on the night before the race. I couldn't bring myself to drink anything in that morning, and all I could stomach was three sweets. So I went into the race quite tired, quite hungry, and definitely dehydrated, although all told not actually feeling too bad.\n\n# Race\n\nThe weather forecast had been worsening all week, so I was mentally steeling myself for pretty heavy rain. In the end, it was a fairly light drizzle, and temperatures were fine. I think the weather made it mentally tougher, but I doubt it had much of an impact physically. I opted to wear a very light hooded jacket and running cap for the race, because that's what I wore on wet training runs and I knew I wouldn't overheat in the jacket, but it would keep the worst of the rain off me.\n\nThankfully, despite Edinburgh being a fairly hilly city, the race route is mostly flat, and is downhill overall, so I didn't have to worry about elevation changes.\n\nAround 11,000 people ran, so the start was very slow - although it was well-managed, with pens released in sequence. It took about 5 minutes for me to be off and running from the actual start of the race, which I gather isn't too bad for a race of this size. The staggered release meant that congestion wasn't too bad, although it was fairly consistently busy throughout the race.\n\nThe actual race is a bit of a blur. Once I got going, I just found my (rough) pace and stuck to it: all my splits were within about 20 seconds of each other. I'd set a \"pacer\" workout on my watch to bring me in under 1:55, and I knew fairly early on that this was achievable. I didn't want to push it and risk blowing up (or injuring myself), so I just plodded along and kept the effort fairly easy. My dad, having started shortly behind me, overtook me 4km in, which was... a little dispiriting, although I was pleased he seemed to be having a good day. I saw him and my friends on the out-and-back section at the end, which was a nice little boost. Crowd support was great, with some fun signs and loads of encouragement, despite the miserable weather!\n\nI crossed the line well within my 2hr and 1:55 targets, with a 1:52:03.\n\n# Post-race\n\nOn some level, I'm pretty pleased with my result. It's a perfectly respectable time, well within the goals I'd ended up setting for myself, and a couple of weeks ago I was pretty convinced I wouldn't even make it round. But I've also ended up feeling a little disappointed, for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, the effort never felt particularly challenging: I feel I could have run much faster, fitness-wise, and I still had plenty in the tank at the end. I probably made the right decision by not pushing it, but part of me wishes I'd taken a bit more of a risk.\n\nThe other factor is that - while I know comparison is the thief of joy - my friends + my dad absolutely smashed their targets, all ending up with 1:4x times - my dad knocked a full 11 minutes off his previous PB, coming in with a 1:46:45. He's 65 years old! Would be inspirational if it weren't so frustrating 😅\n\nThe finish just felt... a bit underwhelming I guess? Between the weather and the layout of the finish area, it was just pretty anticlimactic.\n\nUltimately I think I need to just take this as motivation. I'll definitely be doing another race before too long, and will be taking all the lessons from this one to make it a success. I'm hoping to get a sub-20 5k before the end of the year, and a sub-90 HM is definitely still on the cards within the next 1-2 years. With a better training block, I'm sure I can make it. I don't even think my plan was doomed - if I'd stuck to it, rather than pushing myself too hard, too early on, I think a sub-90 today would've been possible. I'm going to shoot for a 1:45 at the Great Scottish Run in October, and then take it from there.\n\nThanks for reading, and well done to everyone else who ran in Edinburgh today - grim conditions but we made it!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

I’m nothing special when it comes to time or ability but I run between 70-80k a week and for the most part I really enjoy it. However, having spent hours watching shoe reviewers on youtube, the likes of Ben Parkes, The Run Testers, FOD Runner, Kofuzi and so many others I can’t help but feel confused and very sceptical about their opinions. \n\nDo they really notice slight differences in every version of every shoe they test? Do their performances and how they feel really vary so much from shoe to shoe? Or do they just look for something to say to keep their channels relevant? I’m not naive, I know a large part of it is just content creation for the sake of it but maybe there are many runners who do feel such differences. \n\nFor me personally I can certainly feel some difference in certain shoes but for the most part nothing really enormous. \n\nMost shoes are fine, some a little faster than others, some better for long distance etc but generally the standard is good and if I were to blind test them I doubt I could tell the difference. \n\nAm I completely deluded about the differences between shoes and these reviewers who seem so attuned and so  sensitive to every part of every shoe? Or do they, just so they can get more views, spend a lot of time talking absolute shite?\n\nI’d love to hear what the community has to say about them.",

I probably have done 3x 10k races in my entire life and it’s usually a wing it situation, no proper training plan except the last 10k attempted to use c25k but quit halfway and used NRC (kind of). It was a sloppy attempt but eventually got my 5k distance goal completed. I unusual pick the gym over cardio but with my busy work schedule and time spent to get to/from gym or even have access to one during work travel made it inconsistent for my fitness journey. I realized running/walking is the most accessible exercise for me and cheap (if you have self control not buying every shoe on sale lol). It’s safe to say I have a love/hate relationship with running . I hate how it sucks to run, but I love how rewarding it felt after completing it. Aside from keeping up with my cardiovascular health I find it beneficial for my mental health as well. I am fortunate to WFH so I usually do my run at lunch break because it help with stress and also allows me to disconnect from work and reset after a run. It slowly became a habit then a daily routine and I started to view it as therapy for my mental health.  I'm not sure what got into me one day but just the thought of “it would be cool if I could finish a marathon”. So I did some research and find it “doable” if you stick with a training plan. I felt I could commit to this and decided to sign up last October. \n\n\n\n### Training\n\nI chose Hal-Higdon Novice 1 training because it was the first thing that came up on google and seems to be tolerable based on my running experience. Since the program is 18weeks, I had a few months to base build which I didn’t follow any plan, just basically running 5-6 days a week and added miles topping out at 25mi/week. It was rough starting to run again since it’s been a few months from the last 10k. I could barely hold a non stop jogging effort at 5k distance but I stuck to the daily runs and it paid off in building distance and endurance over time. \n\n\n\nOnce I was 18 weeks out, I started the Hal Higdon Novice 1 plan. I overlapped (continue my base build) until the training plan caught up to my long run and mpw. That’s when the real training starts. I was quite pleased with the training plan over all and especially pleased with the schedule because it has the long run on Saturday vs Sunday (what I use during base building)  allowed me to be more flexible in getting it in if I happened to be busy with life events on Sat. I can use Sun (cross training day) as my long run day. I completed nearly every single run (except 1), regardless of snow, rain, or blizzard, I usually find a way to make it happen to go out for a run. \n\n\n\nJust because I did every run doesn't mean I didn't struggled. I had a few bad runs for various reason but the most memorable one was the 18 mile run where I failed. I could only completed 16mi out of the 18mi. My foot was in pain, I didn't wanna force finishing it risking injury because of my \"ego\". I felt guilty, lost confidence by not finishing it but eventually accepted it and moved on. The 20 mile run regained my confidence because for some reason I did better than the 18mi run. My first goal was just to try again for 18mi (vs 20mi) to see how I feel and continued to 20mi if I felt good. I believe part of the success here was that I accidentally carb loaded on the 20 mile run, 2 days before. I had All you can eat Sushi for a friend's bday (ate mostly nigiri) and it happened to be just the perfect fuel for me in the long run. There we're tons of others lessons learned during the training block, especially on the long runs. Here are random issues that came up:\n\n- I had a few hot runs where I was suffering from heat exhaustion, electrolyte imbalances, and on the flip slide I experienced with overheating by over bundling, and learned how important it is to have gloves over an extra shirt on cold runs. This is also when I incorporated salt tabs in to training on hot days. \n\n- GI issues from trying various diets, DIY nutritions/fuel. I found maple syrup and salt works well for training run on the cheap but for race day, invest in gels/chews for convenience. I had to experiment a few brands to see which one I like best/what works. It was down to stinger chews or cliff bloks. I prefer stinger for being less sticky and easier to chew but ended up getting cliff bloks because it was on sale. They both tasted great btw.\n\n- water management / fueling during long run needs a plan. I had bonked on one run because I didn't think I needed to fuel or think i can make it home without refilling my water bottle. It wasn't fun cramping up when you're still a few miles away from home.\n\n- Never trust a fart, always carry some TP and have a plan just incase.\n\n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nNow that the important training block is done and I got my nutrition/fuel figure out. It was time to just \"enjoy\" the taper and prepare for the race. Unfortunately taper period was quite weird/unpleasant for me, it was hard to run low miles, my body was tired, my feet felt heavy and just overall not enjoyable as I thought. My head started messing with my confidence in completing the distance. But I trusted the process as many have said on here, I did what I need to do and now it's just finishing out the plan. I did miss 1 run during taper and it felt guilty. However deep inside I knew it wouldn't made much a difference being a few days before race day. \n\n\n\n48hrs out, I carb loaded with All you can eat sushi again, it was an amazing meal. I set my goal of finishing the race and everything else was a bonus. If I could sustain avg 11min pace would put me under 5hrs and that would put me over the moon. I prepped my race kit in advance to avoid missing anything important. 24hrs out I fucked up and ate a bunch of red meats, greasy, fried food at a party which I didn't know of the consequences until the morning of the race. My knees were inflamed that it was hurting when I bend to get out of bed. I was feeling devastated how I was so careless, in my mind I was just eating whatever to load up my body. But since I was eating somewhat clean weeks before leading up to this, eating this much junk in one night shocked my body I guess. I was really questioning being able to finish the race with this much pain in the knees. \n\n\n\nI continued on to stick with the plan and had my oatmeal with peanut butter and brown sugar for breakfast, drank a bunch of water and head out. I got to the race 1hr early and walking around to find the bag check. I only had 30mins to spare and I really need to use the bathroom. I stood in line for the bathroom with maybe 55 people in front and 15mins went by and there was still 50 people in front of me. There was no way I would make it since my race starts in 15 mins. I decided to skip the bathroom and hold out for the first water station/bathroom at mile 2. So the lesson here is use the bathroom whenever you get a chance don't wait until you get there because the lines might be too damn long.\n\n\n\n### Race\n\n\n\nFuel plan: 1 cliff blokz / hour (got 6 with me), only water from the stations and nothing else. I also got a 5oz soft flask and 4 salt tabs with me just in case.\n\n\n\nLined up for my corral and ready to go! I wasn't as nervous as I thought, I was pretty chill except I couldn't distract myself from needing to find a bathroom after 2mi. I front loaded a cliff blok while waiting for my corral to start. Front loading was something I found super helpful during my experiment with fuel as I rather have it and not need it vs need it and not have it.  Right out the gate, people were energetic, I kept reminding my self to go slow, so I was aiming for 12min/mi pace. But I can see how some people start out too fast because of the adrenaline and crowd energy.  \n\n\n\nGot to the first water station and as I expected, long lines to the bathroom, I guess I wasn't the only one with the same the idea, I burned a few minutes here, lost my pacers and moved on. Weather was finr at this point, I was cruising along my pace but some of the mile marker gave me anxiety lol I was looking at mile 6 marker but then that was a marker for another race. I ran past the mile 22 marker(for the return) on the path and said to myself \"I'll see you again on the way back, can't wait til then.\" I soon caught up to the 5:45 pacer, which was a huge relief because that bathroom break put me quite a bit behind and I was worried I couldn't catch up. After getting to the stadium it was slight incline from there until mile 16. I was a bit nervous with the long incline ahead but I reminded myself that I've trained for this, I ran hills on my training route almost every run. As a result, the incline didn't bother me at all, this is when I started passing a lot people as they slowed down and started walking. Then I saw my 5:30 min pacer and passed him which gave me a nice confident boost. Since this is where I aim to finish from here as long as I maintain my pace. \n\n\n\nGot to mile 15/16 and this is when the heat started to concern me since I've been on an incline the past few miles with the heat pounding on me. I popped the first salt tab and tried to slow down a bit to maintain my body temp. I could feel my breath was getting warm so rather be safe than sorry. I met this girl at the water station and she asked if I had extra fuel so I gave her one of my cliff blok(I hope she's ok) and continued on. At this point we're back on Colfax again heading back, this was a rough stretch because at this point it's probably in the 80s with no cloud coverage and barely any trees. The only good thing is that it's a slight downhill back to the stadium. I was really tempted to take snacks/ice pops/gatorade from spectators/water station but I reminded myself to not fuck up by trying something new. I just continued using water, cliff blokz, and salt tabs.  \n\n\n\nOnce I got to the stadium which is roughly mile 20, I mentally told myself, now is the 2nd half of the marathon. My legs and feet are tired but nothing different from training. I was surprised of the incline after the stadium lol I didn't remember being much of a downhill but I guess it's more noticeable on tired legs. I powered through fine and got to the 22mile marker I said I'll see again early on which is a good feeling that I've made it this far. Just 4 more miles to go! This is when I started to text my wife that I am actually going to finish this marathon and have her get ready to come pick me up after the race. When I got to Broadway on 17th there's a giant hill waiting. I felt like I could've power through it but I didn't want to risk bonking. I decided to walk a bit since I needed to coordinate with the wife anyways so I lost a bit of time. After the hill it's basically a slight incline all the way back to City Park. At this point, I see many people started camping up, and I passed quite a few people. The last mile felt like the longest mile I've ever ran in my life. I kept asking myself where the hell is the park lol eventually, I can see around the corner and tried to contain myself and soaking in all the feeling. It was the best feeling ever crossing that finish line strong w/o bonking the last couple of miles. I crossed at 5h21m ish but I didn't care too much, it was such a surreal feeling finishing my first ever Marathon that I was just overwhelmed with emotions. I will never forget what I had accomplished that day. Such as special thing to do for myself. \n\n\n\n### Post-race\n\n\n\nI wish the family got there sooner to find parking and hang out but it was so busy that I told my wife it's not worth staying, I just went to grab my bag and met up with my wife. My legs were tired but not as bad I thought. We went for All you can eat korean bbq, it was an amazing meal and much needed protein for my recovery. My race shirt was caked with salt the point that it was stiff. After the meal, we head back, and I took a 45m nap. \n\n\n\nIdk what happened but after that 45m nap I felt amazing, I had no issues walking around, legs feels great, still tired but not as tired like after the race. I was surprised, I was expecting some mobility issues but all was well. I remained active through out the day like any normal day. Did my errands, visited family coming into town, watched the Nuggets lost (Sadly!).\n\n\n\nThe next day I felt even better, my body recovered well that I could go for a jog if I wanted to but I stuck to the plan of resting the entire week, saving energy for the weekend and BolderBoulder. I will run it as my recovery run. It's been a few days and my body is feeling better and better each day so I can safely say that the marathon and recovery is a success!\n\n\n\nA few confessions and reflections to end this report:\n\n\n\n - I was not consistent with my stretches, at the beginning of the training block, I was very religious about this. But as I get later into training, I slowly stop stretching and didn't notice much difference. Some days I can see that it may helped but ultimately it didn't make it break it for me. I started reading up about this and it seems to be a controversial topic so do what's best for you.\n\n- Cross training, same with stretching. I was following this religiously early on with some calf raises, body squat but slowly stopped quarter way through. Maybe I would have performed better if did? but most of the time I use cross training day as a \"flex day\" meaning I use it as rest day, family day, the closest \"cross training\" exercise is walking (shopping) around the mall with the wife lol \n\n- I could've reached my sub 5h goal if I stuck with my marathon pace which was doable based on my performance since I didn't feel gassed at the end of the race but hindsight is 20/20 I guess. Leading up to race day I knew it will be hot so I played it safe. With that said, no regrets. I'm over the moon that I finished and hit sub 5:30 and w/o bonking. \n\n\n\nThanks for reading! \n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*\n\nThe mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.\n\nRegardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.\n\nWe are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.\n\n_____\n\n\n###**Recurring Threads**\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question.

A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).\n\nHere are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  \n\n*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.

Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  \n\nThis sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.\n\nIf you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Current MPW + pace\n\n* Previous peak MPW\n\n* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed\n\n* Goals (including specific races)\n\n* Previous PRs\n\n* Other things you think might be helpful to include\n\nBelow are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:\n\n* \"Does anyone else...\" type posts?\n\n* \"Is X a good time for...?\" posts\n\n* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).\n\n* If your question can be asked in one sentence.\n\n* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.\n\n* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.\n\n* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  \n\n* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.\n\nFinally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.\n\n **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  \n\nWhile there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  \n\nThere is a big difference between \"Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?\" and \"My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?\" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.\n\nAlso, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.\n\n_____________________\n\n\nFinally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.\n\n###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**"

        "Texto": "I always admired the simplicity of running as a sport. \n\nYou just need good shoes, some shorts and a shirt and your good to go. But I was never able to establish a running habit in my life. I loved going out for a long bike ride, but running always felt terrible.\n\nSomehow, all of this changed last year in April. \n\nI finished my first half marathon last month. \n\nHere are 3 things I learned that might help you to start a running habit too - even if you currently hate running.\n\n**Start with very short runs**\n\nIn the past I always started running with runs that were too long. \n\nI thought a proper run must be at least 5 km. Everything shorter would be a total waste of time. \n\nLast year, I started my running again with very short runs. The first three weeks or so I didn’t run more than 2 kms per run, but 5 days a week.\n\nAlthough I was completely out of shape, I didn’t feel completely destroyed after these short runs but I was proud that I went out for a run this day. \n\nAnd this built momentum for me to keep going. I went for a run to feel proud of myself and since it didn’t hurt, It wasn’t hard to bring up the willpower to do so.\n\n**Start slow. Really slow** \n\nThis is another classical mistake I made and I’m sure many others make:\n\nI ran too fast. \n\nRunning too fast lets your heart rate rise and your metabolism changes from aerobic to anaerobic. And when the lactate in your muscles accumulates, it starts to hurt. \n\nStaying in lower heart rate zones like your „Zone 2“ (60 - 70 % of your maximum heart rate) does feel much better, it’s also a very effective way to build your base endurance. \n\nAnother benefit is that you don’t feel so exhausted after your run which makes it easier to go out the next day. \n\nAnd the risk for injury is lower too. And trust me: Getting injured while starting to run regularly is easier than you think.\n\nSo go out regularly, but run veeeery slowly. I mean very slow. In the beginning I often altered between running and walking. I still do it. \n\n**Optimize for enjoyment, not performance** \n\nThis point somewhat summarizes the other two.\n\nWhen starting any new habit - like running - it’s important to focus on making it enjoyable. Improving your performance can come later.  All of these advanced tactics to improve your performance don’t matter if you don’t train regularly. \n\nIt doesn’t matter how your running workouts look like, as long as you do and enjoy them. Otherwise you won’t stick to it long enough for your running habit to form. \n\nFor me that meant short and slow runs that didn’t hurt. They were actually fun and I felt great afterwards. Not only was I proud of maintaining my momentum, but I also felt absolutely great after these slow and short runs. And I treated myself to a little snack or a cold alcohol-free beer afterwards. \n\nAll of this associated running with a positive feeling for me. \n\nAnd the next day I wanted to feel that good again, so I went out again. Eventually I saw improvements in my fitness and this motivated me even more. \n\nSo make sure that you do everything to make your runs enjoyable.  \n\n*In the end, that’s what it’s all about anyway.* \n\n\n\n"

In said April my sibling ran a set of Disney races while very pregnant and it lit a, \"I can do that\" fire under my ass.  I signed up for the 5k, 10k, and half during the Princess weekend in february and then the Marathon in Kalamazoo early this year when I decided I actually liked running long distances.  So the training went as follows:  Couch to 5K, Jeff Galloway 10k, Jeff Galloway fairy tale challenge, then a mix of Jeff's marathon post wine and dine and another random one I found online that fit my schedule better.  The training overall went fairly well.  I missed a large stretch in September with a foot injury, and missed a few mid-week runs due to life being crazy.  The biggest mental wall I hit was when I bonked out at mile 18 of the final long run before the Marathon.  I forgot gels and suffered for it, this created a lot of stress heading into the marathon as I'd never run more than 18 and self-doubt heavily creeped in.\n\nAs for strength or other training it was basically non-existent.  I did a lot of pre-post stretching, massage guns, lacrosse balls, etc.  I had a very short period of strength training regime but I heavily lack motivation in that world.  Before any future marathons (will be starting Dopey training in July) I will try and get better in this realm, especially lower legs.\n\n### Pre-race\nTravelled to MI the day before the event.  Got into town and settled into the hotel before prowling around town for a few hours.  Ate a good pasta heavy meal for dinner at Hop Cat before settling in for the evening.\n\nThe morning of the race I got up and dressed before heading to the pre-race area.  Had half a leftover turkey/bacon/avocado wrap (my wife's dinner) and a banana nut muffin.  Chugged a bunch of water and took some ibuprofen right before race start.  Made sure to stretch and keep moving during pre-race ceremonies.  This is such a small race that it was nice to just wander up and down the start/finish area.  Did a bit to stay warm as it was slightly chilly in the morning at about 50F, but didn't layer up because I knew I'd be fine during the race.  Rest of the weather was grey cloudy skies, no rain (rained a bit around mile 13/14 but not much).  A very wet race due to humidity.\n\nIt was also a fun start line since the only other official races I had done were Disney (Massive crowds, multiple waves in multiple corrals) and a smallish 10k in Chicago that had poor organization and a 2ish person wide starting chute.\n\n### Race\nMiles 1-2 were fast, I had that starting excitement, my competitive brain just NEEDED to keep up with people around me, but luckily I didn't burn too crazily because I do run/walk intervals (4:30 and 2:00).  I did this because my knees always felt better on run/walk than pure run.  When I hit mile 2 at under 12/min miles I knew I needed to slow down and did.  \n\nMiles 3-14 is where I was truly in my groove.  My pace was very consistent, varying mostly for the various crazy hills this course has.  I ran for a good 6 or 7 miles bouncing off the 5:30 pace group who would just start to catch me during walk intervals before I'd get space back during run intervals.  This is the main meat of the tougher part of the course as well, a lot of rolling hills, some steep, some not, and a run through a park trail passing a lot of non-race walkers on the path.  I felt really good during this whole stretch and it really helped me dig in mentally and believe I could finish\n\nMile 15 - I lost some pace here as I managed to get a rock in my shoe and stopped to dig it out.  A bit annoying but I was able to get it pretty quick without my body thinking we were done.  \n\nMiles 16-19 I was a bit slower, getting back into my groove of 12:30ish miles was tough because I was all alone at this point and didn't have much around me to gauge off of.  The course here was also a bit less exciting as it was longer stretches on non-scenic roads winding back towards downtown Kalamazoo from Portage.  I also was attempting to slow down just a tad purposefully as I was approaching that PB of 18 miles and fighting the mental idea that I couldn't finish if I went too fast.\n\nMile 20 - My slowest mile, I stopped here at a medical tent as the damp air meant I was fully soaked and my inner right bicep managed to get so chaffed that it was bleeding pretty badly.  Stopped to let them clean it and apply a bandage so I didn't look like a horror movie victim crossing the line.  \n\nMile 21 - Getting back up to speed after my medical stop and spent a lot of this mile doing the mental math to see if I could finish under 5:30 still, a stretch goal of mine.  I'm usually very good at math, it is a strong point of mine, but doing times in my head I managed to come up with that I only needed 13min/miles to meet 5:30.  Post race I did the math (By post race I mean while typing this report) and I need to be doing 11:49s so it wasn't happening but because of bad math I got fired up at least 😆\n\nMiles 22-25 - Here, due to bad math above, I managed to get back into my pace groove finally after the previous 8 miles of up and down, rocks and medical issues, etc.  I felt really good and it was here that I finally was released from the idea that I wouldn't finish.  I actually felt really good and had that great running revelation that my training worked.  Everything was starting to hurt, and I could feel the muscles losing their will to live, but I knew I could push through it to the end.  I was also somewhere around mile 23/24 that I lost some feeling in my left toes.\n\nMile 26 - at about 25.5 miles I reentered downtown and spurred by the notion that I was less than a mile out I hit the anti-wall, I felt SO GOOD and just jubilant, right up until my right quad decided to MAJORLY cramp and spasm.  It didn't deflate me at all since I knew, at that point, that I had right around an hour to cut off time to do 1 mile, but it hurt BAD.  I chugged the rest of my flipbelt water and massaged while I walked for about half a mile.  I got it to the point I could run again and I told my leg (out loud in front of spectators and other runners), and I quote, \"Just shut the fuck up for a quarter mile you stupid bastard.\"  I'm pretty sure one spectator clutched their pearls but whatever.\n\nFinal stretch - at this point I was good, I ran through the slight pain, turned the final corner and crossed the finish line.  My first ever marathon in the books and the longs continuous run I had ever done bested by 8.2 miles.  My race fuel strategy was a gel every 5 miles with the last at mile 24 instead of 25.  I took one extra as a backup that I did use at mile 20 when my stomach started rumbling a bit.\n\n### Post-race\nBeing a smaller marathon the post-race was much calmer.  There was a decent sized crowd left for us last 40-50 runners, but my wife was able to just stand in the road behind the finish line, got a good picture of me and all that fun jazz.  I rang the first time finisher bell, grabbed a banana and a chocolate milk from the tables and wandered into the post-race expo area with an absolute high of serotonin and self-pride.  Grabbed a pork taco from a taco truck before heading to the car, changing shirts, and hitting the road for the 3 hour drive home.  Unfortunately I am too slow to have kept my hotel room for a shower after the race, but I was mostly wet and not too sweaty/smelly so the wife didn't have to suffer too much.\n\nAs a final piece to this race report I will leave the first train of thoughts that I had after crossing the finish line about the race.  It went like this:\n\n\"What a stupid distance, I don't understand why anybody does this, it hurts, it's stupid, I'm stupid for doing this, I hated everything about that, and I can't wait to do it again.\"  The rawest reaction which of course now a few weeks later I can look back and see that I didn't hate the race at all, I really enjoyed it, but thought I'd share that funny slew of hatred with everyone.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "[https://imgur.com/a/IQgKkXE](https://imgur.com/a/IQgKkXE)\n\nI bought a bunch of cheap running socks to experiment so you don’t have to. Here are some factors to keep an eye on.\n\nSock thickness: Some call it cushioning, but the important part here is the volume of the sock, not how soft it is. If your shoe fits snugly, then anything but a liner-like thin sock may contribute to squeezing your foot unnecessarily and causing blisters. The width in the toe box is the most important here, and thicker socks would decrease it more.\n\nCushioning placement: There are four main places where it is important: in front and under the toes, around the heel, around the arch, and on top of the foot. I tend to habitually jam my toes into the front of the shoe no matter the heel lock, so having ample cushioning in front of the sock is most important. I also prefer to have breathable material on top of the sock to help with ventilation.\n\nSeams: Seams tend to be thicker, and when jammed into a shoe, they can cause blisters. Most socks have a seam on top of the toes. With most cheaper socks the edge of the seam that sits on the side of the bit toe tend to be thicker and would cause blisters (see the photo). I started examining and clipping the edges with scissors when necessary, even if it may cause a hole down the line.\n\nMaterial: Pure cotton is a no-no due to moisture absorption, but you would never see that in an actual running sock. The socks that are furry on the inside seem to cause the least blistering, but those are never thin.\n\nHow would I buy the next running sock? I’ll make sure that my shoes are accommodating enough for not the thinnest sock. I’ll get a sock with cushioning around the toes and as little material as possible on the top of the foot. I would examine the seams, especially seam ends. I would adjust my laces to remove any added pressure from the arch. I would not choose the thickest sock unless my shoe is too big, and I would not care about exact material mix or compression."

        "Texto": "\n*Race Name:* No Time To Die Frontyard Ultra\n\n*Start:* Friday 17 May 12pm\n\n*Entrants:* Just over 150\n\n*Location:* Edge of Central Business District Adelade, South Australia (Victoria Park)\n\n*Lap distance:* circa 6.71km\n\n*Total i raced:* 115.3km - winner did 396km\n\n*Organisers:* Ultra Series SA\n\n*Me:* 35 Male, Australian\n\n \n\n*Training and lead up*\n\nI’ve been running for almost 2.5 years now, with a primary focus on Zone 2 base building for the last two years.\n\nMy running goals are too varied - with wanting a fast 5km (PB: 19:39), a sub-50 12.1km (PB: 51:30), the six major marathons (done one non-major, 3:48, impacted by double quad cramps), a BQ marathon time, and 100milers (done a 50km ultra, a trail mara, and a road mara).\n\nHowever, this was to be an A Race.\n\nFurther, I started a Pfitz 18/55 marathon training block four weeks before the race with a 3:15 target, and diligently completed each planned run for the first two weeks.\n\nBefore the Pfitz block, I hit 93km in the week.\n\nFebruary was 244km, March was 276km, April was 260km, May-to-date is 206km (from 6 runs). 46km/week on average for last 12 months.\n\nSpecific training was 6 laps on-course, 7 laps from home (35degrees), 6 laps on-course.\n\nTwo weeks before the Frontyard Ultra, I hurt my Achilles in my circa 3rd run using Alphafly 3, setting a HM PB on a Pfitz training run. I then did a horrible 6.5km on the Saturday, then six laps of the frontyard ultra course on Sunday with tears in the eye from pain (my first 100km week).\n\nSaw a GP on Monday, got an ultrasound on Tuesday, got ultrasound results on Wednesday, saw a sportsdoctor on Thursday.\n\nDiagnosis: Sub-acute tendonitis, everything that could be inflamed is inflamed, and a bursa.\n\nSportsdoctor: “The risk of doing the ultramarathon without doing a rupture is acceptable, but the risk of a tear in the medium term is unacceptable without taking appropriate action. Do the ultra, then come back a week later (which is still two days from now) to start treatment. “\n\nEveryone else in my life, including the GP: “don’t run.”\n\nHad pain at rest for pretty much all of this time, and a reasonable amount over the following 8 days – but less so by a couple of days before the race. Over this 12 day period I only did one run, a fairly slow parkrun halfway-through.\n\nLate decision: Do the race, but try to avoid doing a permanent injury, don’t set a distance goal, just focus on learning stuff for next year.\n\n \n\n*Pre-Race:*\n\n·         Packing list included circa 85 items\n\n·         Got picked up at 9:20am, arrived 10:00am\n\n·         Had a premium gazebo site (#recommended), which cost an extra $50.\n\n·         Set-up took about 30 minutes -> Mainly fluffing around with getting the gazebos appropriately lined up on the pre-booked site.\n\n·         Toilet’s were inadequate for the first 8 hours or so before six more opened – but, by then, it was dark so bush wees were the order of the night.\n\n·         Target was originally 50mins per lap\n\n·         Weather was sunny and max of about 21, and a minimum of around 13/14.\n\n \n*Race:*\n\nUsed Garmin FR955 with highish brightness, and most accurate GPS, which used around 4% battery per hour.\n\n*Laps:*\n\n48:35\n\n49:45\n\n50:01\n\n49:06\n\n47:52\n\n49:20\n\n50:04\n\n50:15\n\n50:29\n\n52:18\n\n51:37\n\n51:30\n\n51:24\n\n50:45\n\n51:30\n\n53:30\n\n56:53 (deliberately slow – knew it was the last lap – had already asked Wifey to pack up)\n\nStarted the 18th lap, just because, and rung the bell after 58seconds. One other person did too.\n\nI started with a run 1km, walk 1km strategy, but this went out the window pretty quickly and became not-strict as I wanted to talk to certain other competitors -> eg, mates, acquaintances I knew from other races, Johan Botha (eventual winner with 59 laps, also shoutout to Joel Sexton for the assist), some guy wearing a UTMB 2023 top, etc – so I was more than happy to change when I walked/ran to have those conversations. I don’t think that negatively impacted me.\n\n\nAlso, as the race went on (from about lap 11), my comfortable running speed was slipping from originally 5:15/km through to 6 to 7:30mins, to even 8mins by the end, which meant needing to run for the significant majority of the lap, and/or running at an uncomfortable speed. My comfortable walking speed also increased from 9:30/km to 13:30/km.\n\nI believe that there were 35 runners that completed lap 17.\n\nA lot of others were trying to do 3mins run, 2 mins walk, or 5mins run, 3mins walk, or some other variant, at the start.\n\n*Nutrition:*\n\nDrink: I drank 500ml on each of about 11 of the first 13 laps (and 350ml on the other two), and averaged about 400ml a lap for the remaining four laps. I also drank between each lap. I generally alternated between Tailwind (100g of carbs)/Powerade (1.5L(90g carbs)) /maurten drink mix (40g carbs) and water, on top of two cups of coke and a can of solo. I weighed the same when I got home versus when I left home – implying I drank slightly too much but was pretty spot on (noting that I ate food, so, I essentially lost “water” weight equal to the weight of food I ate). I wish I had packed another tailwind or two.\n\nI ate a lot:\n\nPrerace: rice bubbles, juice, killer python, banana x2, peanut butter sandwich, small packet of crisps.\n\nEach hour: Approx. 50-90g of carbs every hour (probably more than necessary, but, without having gut issues I am happy with this decision), including liquid carbs, 6 killer pythons (101g carbs), 3 sandwiches, a small handful of koda gels and two handfuls of maurten gels, 150g of Haighs Speckles, a banana, watermelon pieces, chicken crimpys, small packet of tiny teddy’s, 3 small bags of crisps, 2xnaak waffles, hot chips, few lollies, a little bit of soup, etc. Generally one or two pieces whilst running, and one piece between laps.\n\nI can confidently remember 1028g of carbs (60.5g/hour) – but probably missed a couple of pieces of food. For clarity, I also ate a lot in the hour before the race that I’m not including in this 1028g.\n\n \n\n*Drugs:* I also took Celecoxib (on-top of morning dose), 4*Panadeine Forte, 2*Panadeine, 2*Panadol, 2*Nurofen --< I couldn’t have done many laps without these.\n\n \n\n*Shoes:* I started in RC Elite v2, started to get knee pain, changed to Superblast, got worse knee pain, changed back to RC Elite v2, got 2 killer blisters on the side of my heel, changed to SC Trainer and had no additional feet problems – but the blisters were genuinely painful.\n\n \n\n*Why did I quit?*\n\nIt was 5am, and I didn’t think it was worth trying to make it to sunrise at 7:05. I was in pain and didn’t fancy taking more opioids (Palexia was all I had left that I could find), my gut was starting to think about maybe playing up, my original goal pre-injury was 15 laps, my longest previous run before was 53km, my wife had been crewing for 12 straight hours and seemed disappointed when I went out for one of my final laps (she was telling people I was about to quit from lap 11). I became worried I was going to be permanently injuring my Achilles / rupture it… but, yes, I could have kept going if I needed to.\n\n \n\n*Post race*\n\nWent home, showered, slept for 2hours.\n\nBeen in constant pain since.\n\nMy ankle has swollen and continued to swell since, and I can’t really bend it still, which means I can’t walk anywhere near properly. It got worse from straight after the race Saturday morning, through to Monday, and is now getting better again (Tuesday) and is similar to how it looked on Sunday, but with a bit more mobility.\n\n \n\n*Statistics from Garmin*\n\n·         142 average HR (my max is about 200)\n\n·         9:49hours run, 5:00 walk, 2:12 rest\n\n·         660 exercise load\n\n·         492m ascent (491 descent).\n\n \n\n*Overall*\n\nA great race – if my Achilles is healed up, I’ll be back next year – hopefully with the sole target of timing out on a lap and not stopping until then.\n\nI’m happy with how I performed, originally, I was a touch bummed I “couldn’t be bothered” pushing through when I was still making laps with 7 minutes to spare… but, given how swollen my ankle is three days later I know I made the right call to stop (and probably should have done so earlier!)… and, like I said, wifey had crewed all through the night for 12 straight hours already, so it was time to go.\n\nFor next year, I think I’ll try to find some people to crew me until midnight or something, then have wifey come down for the 1am lap, instead of being there from 4pm or 5pm.\n\nI think I need to skip my next planned A race – the Adelaide marathon - to give me Achillies time to heal properly.\n\n \n\n\n*Packing list (x denotes I didn’t use at least one instance of this item)*\n\nRunning shirts x3 (only used the pair I wore there)\n\nThermal trousers (x)\n\nThermal top x2\n\nUndies (x)\n\nThick running socks\n\nThin running socks (x)\n\nDressing gown\n\nSoap (x)\n\nTowels x2\n\nIce\n\nEsky\n\nTable (1.8m – absolutely necessary)\n\nGood chair\n\nRunning vest\n\nRunning belt (x)\n\nSoft flasks x2\n\n400ml mt franklin (x)\n\n750ml water bottle\n\nGels\n\nSports bars (x!)\n\nDrink mix\n\nTailwind\n\nPowerade x2\n\nVentolin\n\nAtrovent (x)\n\nCelecoxib\n\nPortable battery\n\nGarmin cable\n\nUsb cables\n\nUgg boots\n\n10L water box\n\nCramp fix\n\nBlister bandaids\n\nAnkle strapping for blisters\n\nTweezers (x)\n\nNail clippers (x)\n\nHoody (x)\n\nRunning jacket x2 (x)\n\nGloves x2 (x – but did put a pair into my vest and very almost wore them)\n\nDrugs\n\nToothbrush and paste\n\nCohesive bandage (x – but in vest for emergencies)\n\nChewies\n\nHeadlamp\n\n6xAAA batteries – should have brought 9, but it was fine.\n\nBuff\n\nToilet paper (x, but in vest)\n\nTissues\n\nRunning shorts x2 (only used the pair I wore there)\n\nRunning tights x2 (only used the pair I wore there)\n\nRubbish bags\n\nHeadphones (x)\n\nPhone\n\nHouse keys\n\nSuperblast\n\nRC elite v2\n\nSC trainer\n\nSpeedgoat 5 (X)\n\nBeanie (x)\n\nVegemite sandwich x2 - crustless\n\nPeanut butter sandwich x2 – crustless\n\nBananas\n\nSalomon speedcup\n\nSticky tape (x)\n\nScissors\n\nKiller python x16\n\nTape for bandages (x)\n\nSuncream (x)\n\nHat x2\n\nCompression shorts x2 (only used the pair I wore there)\n\nSmall crisps x4\n\nVaseline (only what I put on pre-race)\n\nTea-towel (x)\n\nPens\n\nPaper\n\nTorch (x)\n\nHandwash (x)\n\nSnake bandage (x)\n\nFloss (x)\n\nDeodorant (x)\n\nExplorer socks\n\nCharger (x)\n\nHand sanitizer\n\nBeach cart\n\nAsked wife to bring after it started:\n\nChicken crimpys\n\nMassage gun\n\nSleeping bag to be kept in car, just incase (x)\n\n\n\nRace Day Pics\n\nhttps://ibb.co/j4sKNQ0\nhttps://ibb.co/cwvfnYr\nhttps://ibb.co/s3VxHfB\n\nAnkle pics Saturday 630am\n\nhttps://ibb.co/p492wcL\nhttps://ibb.co/CtQDC81\n\nAnkle pics Sunday / Monday\n\nhttps://ibb.co/Gkgtw2p\nhttps://ibb.co/C76GfvR\nhttps://ibb.co/C0TWPcH\nhttps://ibb.co/sJCSt9t\n\nGarmin pics\nhttps://ibb.co/GVtmBBN\nhttps://ibb.co/yBt3zVZ ",

        "Texto": "Howdy folks, I ran my first ever full (but most certainly NOT my last) marathon yesterday and wanted to share my experience! I signed as kind of a spur of the moment impulse after running 18 miles for the first time last October. I’m SO glad I did, because it was an amazing and eye-opening experience. I never thought I would have the time, energy or stamina to do a full marathon, but a good friend of mine who has done several gave me good advice last year that really changed my perspective. Anyway, on to the report, and I’ll try to keep it brief!\n\n\n### Race Information\n* **Name:** Cleveland Marathon\n* **Date:** Sunday, May 19, 2024\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Cleveland, OH\n* **Website:** [https://www.clevelandmarathon.com](https://www.clevelandmarathon.com)\n* **Strava:** [https://www.strava.com/activities/11448481433](https://www.strava.com/activities/11448481433)\n* **Time:** 3:48:20\n\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Finish | \\*Yes\\* |\n| B | Sub 4:00:00 | \\*Yes\\* |\n| C | Sub 3:45:00 | \\*No\\* |\n| D | No walking | \\*Yes\\* |\n| E | Miles 20-26 faster than 10:00 | \\*Yes\\* |\n\n\n### Splits\n\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 8:24\n| 2 | 8:16\n| 3 | 8:01\n| 4 | 8:15\n| 5 | 8:00\n| 6 | 7:59\n| 7 | 8:19\n| 8 | 8:25\n| 9 | 8:10\n| 10 | 8:17\n| 11 | 8:24\n| 12 | 8:26\n| 13 | 8:18\n| 14 | 8:27\n| 15 | 8:35\n| 16 | 8:19\n| 17 | 8:35\n| 18 | 8:58\n| 19 | 8:36\n| 20 | 8:53\n| 21 | 9:21\n| 22 | 9:17\n| 23 | 9:21\n| 24 | 9:24\n| 25 | 9:55\n| 26 | 9:10\n| 27 | 8:28\n\n\n\n### Training\n\nFor several months now I've been focusing on intervals and ever-increasing distances for my long runs. Regarding intervals, they were tough at first, especially since my first time doing it it was pouring rain and standing water in a lot of places I was running. But in spite of that, I enjoyed it. After doing them for a few weeks, I noticed I could run faster with less exertion, and generally recovered faster from my harder workouts. As far as distance running is concerned, I had previously ran 15-18 miles quite a few times, and generally felt very good during and after each of those runs. I have ran a half marathon at least once a month, each month, for over a year now, and always felt very comfortable doing it. Then, about a month prior to the race, I set out to attempt my first ever 20 mile run... and failed, (I posted about it here actually in one of the daily questions thread) only making it 13 miles. But to be honest, I knew the reasons why I didn’t have it in me that day, shrugged it off, and went out 3 days later and accomplished it. That cemented in my mind that I was likely “ready” and “able” to do the marathon.\n\n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nWithout going into details, through a small series of humorous events, I ended up signed up for 4 races in a row, each one on a separate weekend. Two half marathons, followed by a 5k, then the full marathon. I was a little worried that this would mess up my marathon, but fortunately there were two full weeks between my last half and the full, with only the 5k in between. So I just took it easy on the 5k and week following it, made sure to follow a healthy diet (for example no alcohol for basically two weeks prior, as well as higher carbs the days prior), and tried to get to bed earlier.\n\nFast forward to the morning of the race, and because of an issue with parking in downtown Cleveland (we had a spot reserved and paid for at a lot, which ended up being full, which really pissed me off), we were running out of time and my wife had to drop me off and go off on her own to find parking (she wasn’t running, but wanted to be at the starting line to watch me take off). Fortunately, she managed to find a spot within minutes and made it on time! After dropping off my bag at the gear check and finagling my way to a port-a-potty for a last minute number two, I got a little lost trying to find where I was supposed to enter the corrals at, but finally made it in with about 3 minutes to go til the race started. So I was a little nervous but very excited to be there.\n\n\n\n### Race\n\nI started in corral B, and during the first 3 miles or so was getting passed by a fair amount of people. But every time I checked my watch I was pretty much on pace for where I wanted to be at that point in the race, and also sticking just behind the 3:40:00 pacers, so I just ignored it and kept plugging along. I’ve done enough half marathons and other races to know some folks come out of the gate a little too fast and burn out, and I would likely end up catching up to and passing them several miles later. Honestly, none of that really matters, as I’m not out there to compete against anybody but myself, but a constant stream of people passing you can have a psychological effect even if you don’t want it to.\n\nThe support along the route was phenomenal! It was the largest race I’ve been a part of, with the Columbus Half a close second. I imagined however, that after the halfway point, the support would significantly drop off, since the vast majority of the runners were doing the half marathon. While the support did drop off, there was a surprising amount of support on the “back half”, even though miles 14-26 took us quite a ways away from downtown, all the way out to Edgewater Park via several neighborhoods. But even in the neighborhoods, there were so many local residents sitting on their porches and balconies, cheering us on, and quite a few with their own little refreshment stations set up, handing out water, electrolytes, fruit, granola bars, even pickles. I’ve never been so happy to eat an orange in my life! Others had their sprinklers or hoses out to help us cool off as we ran by (which I took advantage of EVERY time haha).\n\nAround mile 15, I ended up having to backtrack about 30 yards because my medical dog tag came off my neck; DOH! At mile 16 I was bummed to see a young guy convulsing on the ground, but fortunately the paramedics were there and no doubt taking good care of him. At mile 17, the rear-most 3:40:00 pacer caught me and ran with me for a bit before he mentioned he had to catch up to the group further up the road. I said no big deal and he moved on. At mile 19 or so, I saw a long hill that formed part of the final stretch and remembered that most of the elevation was in the last few miles, but I just shrugged and put it out of my mind. After mile 20, I definitely slowed my pace; in part because that was the farthest I had ever run before, in part because of the increased elevation changes, and in part because it’s mile 21 and that’s when you hit the wall, right? Well I never felt I “hit a wall”, I just felt like I was starting to get tired. But I had kept a steady routine of consuming a gel every 45 minutes or so, and grabbing a water and electrolytes at every station, so I was confident that I had the reserves to keep going without having to stop to walk. Then I hit mile 24, which was that hill I had seen earlier, and it was a bit of a struggle. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, but I did notice my pace dropping below 10:00, so I refocused on my breathing, skipped to a motivating song (Rage Against the Machine: The Ghost of Tom Joad in case you’re wondering) and kept on trucking. I managed to finish that mile at 9:55, just under my goal of keeping miles 21-26 at under 10:00... PHEW! At mile 25, the next pacer (3:50:00) caught up to me and another guy going across a large bridge. We got to chatting, asking him about his experience as a pacer, and sharing our story, and it turns out the other guy was doing his first marathon as well. That little chit chat gave me a boost to hit it hard on the last half mile.\n\nAt the end of the bridge was a huge group of people cheering everybody on, and the music was so great I paused mine and just soaked in the experience. At the last turn, I could see the finish line, about a quarter of a mile away. I have this thing where I always want to sprint the last stretch before the finish line, but wasn’t sure if I would be able to for a marathon. But I felt pretty good, so I went for it and ended up hitting a 4:49 pace! That surprised me, because while I’ve hit sub 5:00 pace quite a few times doing intervals, and can maintain that speed over a 400m distance, I didn’t think I would be able to do it after running 26 miles. So it felt great to know I still had “gas in the tank”. I crossed the finish line, heard my name and shouted “that’s me!!!”, after which I immediately looked for the banana haha.\n\n\n\n### Post-race\n\nAfter crossing the finish line, I did feel somewhat disoriented and clumsy. So I sipped on some water and chocolate milk, found my wife (or rather, she found me), unlaced my shoes and then waddled over to one of the grassy areas and laid flat on my. I took advantage of the free beer and massage tables, took some pictures, took in the atmosphere, headed to the car and then home. I spent most of the rest of the day on the couch haha.\n\nTo be honest, I felt great after the race, and even the rest of the day. I didn’t have any discomfort or pain, and my right ankle which has a tendency to get really tight after a race felt completely normal. I chalk it up to good preparation, the shoes I used that day (actually used my “recovery run” shoes instead of my race shoes), making sure they weren’t laced too tight, making sure not to overdo it with my pacing, and immediately unlacing my shoes afterwards.\n\nI spent most of the rest of my day reflecting on what I love about races: the camaraderie. The sense of unity amongst thousands of people from all walks of life, who might not have much in common, but at least share an interest if not a love for running. To me, both the participants and the people who support them, be them event volunteers or local residents, give me a glimpse into what people are capable of. Races bring out the good in us, the sense of belonging and acceptance, and is a humbling and encouraging experience. This was my first full marathon, but it won’t be my last!\n\nAlso... sorry... I tried to keep it brief... and failed haha.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

I'd only played sports that involved short sprinting efforts and absolutely despised running the mile in gym class, but my roommate started training for a 5K and asked me to join her for a run and I said 'yeah why not?' I caught the running bug pretty quickly and ended up getting pretty significant posterior shin splints by November. I didn't run at all in December because of how bad they were. I started running again semi-consistently in January of 2024. I was hoping to see enough progress to run a half marathon this month, but realized pretty quickly that I was going to need a lot more time for that so I set my sights on the Harpoon 5-Miler. I was running an average of 3 days a week, sometimes 4 days, but there were weeks I didn't run at all. My training also wasn't structured at all and since I was still dealing with on/off shin splints, I spent nearly all my runs just trying to put in easy miles at around a 12:30-13:30/mi pace. My heart rate was wicked high during every single run at first, and I thought there might actually be something wrong with me, but I did a max HR time trial sometime in March with a chest strap and it seems I actually just have a lil rabbit heart since Garmin reported my max HR at 212. By March I was trying to use HR to train but I wasn't consistent with it because my heart rate would jump into zone 4 after about 5 minutes. I also started incorporating strength training 3 days a week in March, but I burned myself out by trying to do too much between running and strength training without an organized training schedule. There was a full 7 days in early April where I just didn't run at all because of the burnout and coming back from that whole week off felt like I had never run before in my life. It was like I had started all over again aerobically, and I actually was really nervous I wouldn't be able to run the 5-Miler. Then I got sick with a pretty miserable cold the first two weeks of May and had to take the second week of May off nearly entirely because of it. The week leading up to the race, I was feeling on the up and up and ran an easy run, a tempo run, and a really easy workout with short strides.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThis being my first race I was pretty anxious and just tried to remember all the things I had put down on my mental list like ensuring I was hydrated in the week leading up to the race, especially after having been sick. I woke up the morning of, skipped my coffee because I was terrified of the prospect of having tummy issues pre-race. I drank 20 oz of water with a Nuun + caffeine tablet and a Body Armor Lyte. I ate a slice of bread with powdered peanut butter about 3 hours before the race. I got to Harpoon around 9 AM to check out the vendors and just get an idea of what everything looked like. The weather was absolutely miserable. It was in the mid 50s temperature wise, and there was a constant fine mist coming down. My tennis shoes were wet by the time I got to the starting line from the mist and puddles and just walking around in the wet. I wasn't sure what that would do for my performance, but I opted to skip a little warm up jog I had planned to avoid splashing in any more puddles. I ran in a sweatshirt over a t shirt and bike shorts. I downed half a pack of Gu energy chews about 30 minutes before lining up at the starting line, really just for the sake of the placebo effect. We walked to the starting line at 9:45.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race started exactly at 10 AM and I was somewhere toward the front of the starting line area amongst the 5,000 runners. People started moving forward and before I knew it I was out there.... running a race. I had a curated playlist going and the Nike Run Club 8k Run guided run track with Coach Bennett in my ears. I was just trying to focus on moving forward. I was a little demoralized for a second as I was getting passed by SO many people and was fighting an intrusive thought that I might be the absolute last person to finish the race, but I just kept telling myself that I just had to focus on running my own race. I knew I wasn't the fastest runner out there, I knew people would be passing me, and I just had to tell myself that over and over and over. I was avoiding looking at my watch because I didn't want to psych myself out about my pace but then I saw a girl in front of me stop to walk and I looked at my watch to see where we were in the race and saw that I was running at a 10:10 pace!!!! I immediately started panicking thinking 'oh my god, I'm going too fast, I'm going to burn out, there's no way I can sustain this for FIVE miles!!' So after that nice little rabbit hole I had to just put my arm down and tell myself to just keep going and there was plenty of time for me to slow down if I needed to adjust my pace. After that I tried really really hard not to look at my watch for pace, only distance. I got to the water station at 1.5 miles and my partner and friend were there cheering me on, so that was a nice boost. At the 2 mile mark, I saw a timer with 20 something minutes on the clock and I nearly shat myself I was so shocked. I wasn't feeling out of breath, but my shins/calves were definitely feeling the pace I was running at but I just kept thinking 'Okay, that's something I can deal with, as long as I can breathe.' So I kept going and before I knew it, I was at the turnaround point at 2.5 miles. Then I was running back along the stretch I'd already come through and that gave me a good mental boost. I hit the 3 mile mark and had to shake out my arms and shoulders from the tension of the adrenaline and I peeked at the timer and I was doing a lot better than I thought I would be doing at that point. At mile 4, I was feeling pretty good and knowing the race was almost over made me feel SO good knowing that I was about to accomplish this huge huge goal that I never thought possible. At 4.25 miles I got the idea to pick up the pace since my watch was reading 41 minutes and at 4.5 miles I realized that was not a good idea and not something I could sustain for that long HAHA. I kept trying to figure out when to just start sprinting, but I held it in until I could physically see the finish line. Then I opened up my stride, dug super deep and was ready to absolutely fling myself across the finish, and it was going great, I was booking it, I felt like LIGHTNING and then two girls moved in front of me and I had to physically put my hands up and lean back so I didn't run into their backs but I crossed the finish line at 51:38 and I wasn't even out of breath and I was so super proud of myself for finishing without walking, and even more so for running faster than I ever though possible to sustain for FIVE ENTIRE MILES. I know that's such a short distance to a lot of endurance runners, but I was just so in awe of my own ability at that moment, and honestly still am. I had no idea that I had that much grit and endurance and it was really incredible to see the manifestation of all of my chaotic and unstructured training because I can only imagine now what might be possible if I just put some real effort into being consistent with it. I was nervous that I might actually be the last runner in, but I finished in 2820th place out of 5,000, which isn't half bad to me for the way my training and taper period played out. I'm so proud of myself and can't wait to see what I'm able to accomplish in the future. I wish I had been able to experience more of the vibes though. With my headphones in, and being so in my head, I feel like I hardly noticed the spectators and the cheering. Lesson learned for the next one!\n\n  \nHonestly if you made it through all of this, thank you. I never thought I'd be writing a race report ever, so I'm just happy to be here.\n"

My goal since last summer has primarily been to improve my aerobic pace with Z2 running. Comparing my HR during runs now to last year seems to indicate I've seen a lot of improvement there, and I can feel that. Another goal of mine since my last race was to work on strength after having issues with my adductors and glute, but I don't think I quite followed through on that. For the first few months of the year I was okay about going to the gym and doing leg curls, split squats, and core work, but I kind of fell out of the habit eventually. I also went to a few strength training classes that would leave me sore for several days, but I need to do that more often to really build on it; I did feel my hamstrings were stronger from doing deadlifts and step-downs.\n\nIn some of my long runs I wore a vest and had the idea that maybe I'll carry a vest during the race this time so that I could always have hydration and even add some pomegranate juice/coconut water to a flask for easy access to carbs and electrolytes. This worked well, but I ultimately decided after the training runs that the bouncing would be too annoying, I would sweat more because of the vest, and I am pretty good about drinking lots of water outside of running.\n\nI didn't do a lot of speed work in my training, but when I did up the intensity, I noticed I would sometimes feel some tightness on the right side of my chest, which is an issue I had in high school. At the time I was worried it was a heart issue, but I got a lot of tests done to indicate there were no issues. The issue is that I don't change up how I breathe between easy runs (long, slow breaths) and hard runs. I think I need to breathe more intensely to avoid diaphragm tightness, and more speed training will help with that.\n\nMy shoe rotation was Saucony Triumph 20s as my daily trainers, Kinvara 13s as my speed shoe, and I picked up a pair of Endorphin Speed 3s from Winners for $60 a few months ago which I've been using for speed and long runs, which complement my Endorphin Pro 3 race shoes.\n\nMy Garmin race prediction was 3:19. My personal feeling was that I could achieve that goal if it was a flat race, but I was skeptical on how I would perform on the course. I looked up other race reviews, watched a video of the race, and tried to think about how I would handle the hills, but knew that I didn't have enough experience to not have it be a factor.\n\n### Pre-race\n\n#### Flight and Expo\n\nTwo Fridays before the race I did Anaerobic intervals and that was probably a mistake because my adductor was sore for over 4 days after that. I probably still felt the effects of that on race day.\n \nI did my 5k shakeout run in my race shoes Friday morning. I had leftover pasta before leaving for the airport in the late afternoon. I flew to Vancouver on in the evening, arriving at night. \n\nOn Saturday, I went to the grocery store immediately after waking up since it was closed after we arrived the night before. The main things I got for myself that were race-relevant were gluten free quick oats, coconut water, apple and orange juice, honey, sunflower seed butter, soy milk, and a carton of cold brew coffee.\n\nI went to the expo to get my bib before we got lunch in Gastown. We went to MeeT, and I got the Philly Cheezesteak Poutine and Oyster Mushroom Calamari which I shared with my GF. They had an issue with my friend's order so they offered him a free dessert which he was nice enough to share, so I got to have a bit of his brownie too!\n\nAfter lunch I recommended everyone check out Stanley Park on their own so I could go home and rest my legs. I stopped by Nesters to pick up a GF Caulipower Pizza for dinner to have with some juice. My blood sugar spiked from the poutine at lunch, so I took some insulin to correct that, pre-emptively took insulin for the pizza I was about to have, and took a nap. After that, I put the pizza in the AirBnB's toaster oven (on top of some foil to avoid cross-contamination), but this ended up being a mistake. We discovered later in the week that the toaster oven stops working after a minute or two. When I ate my pizza I noticed it was a bit soft but figured it may have just been the texture: now I know it was likely undercooked, and I feel stupid for not realizing that. \n\n#### Race Day\n\nThe start time for the marathon was 8:30am and I was in the first corral. I woke up at 5:30am and had my oatmeal (quick oats microwaved in water, a spoon of sunflower seed butter, splash of soy milk, superseed blend (chia, hemp, and toasted buckwheat groats), and honey), and a tall glass of cold brew coffee + soy milk. Shortly after waking up I realized I had an upset stomach, so naturally I started feeling stressed that I would have GI issues during the race (see comments about the pizza above). We worried that I may have accidentally ingested gluten due to my group of 7 having gluten in my vicinity, not realizing it was probably the pizza. I had to use the washroom a few times, and hoped it would pass. I had a 500ml bottle of nuun with water mixed with orange juice that I sipped on for the next hour since I saw a Ben Parker video where he did that. Thankfully I wasn't stuck in the bathroom all morning, but I was worried I would feel sick during the race.\n\nWith me I brought:\n\n\n* 5 Huma gels (I don't recall if any of them were caffeinated, but it was Blueberry, Chocolate, and Mocha flavours). I had 2 left after the race.\n* 2 Larabars (1 cashew cookie, 1 peanut butter chocolate chip)\n* A pack of salt tabs (I'd never taken one but got a free sample at the SF marathon and wanted to have them in case I cramped up for emergency purposes)\n* Insulin pump and phone (wish I didn't need to carry a pump with me but it is what it is)\n* GF cookies and cream Honey Stinger waffle\n* A ziploc bag with two Gravels in case of stomach issues\n\n\nI was staying in Mount Pleasant and wasn't close to a SkyTrain station. It would have been a 45 minute walk to the start line, but I intended to walk to Main Street and take the 8am bus going south (I originally meant to take the 7:45 bus but my stomach problems delayed my exit). I got to the stop at 7:55, saw a bus approach a few minutes later thinking it was mine, but it said \"Sorry, not in service.\" *Oh well*, I thought, *it'll probably come in a minute.* A few minutes pass and no bus came. A different one did that wasn't the one I needed to take. I checked the Transit app and the bus I needed to get on was showing as having already passed. I guess it was the \"not in service\" one? Maybe it was full? I asked some people at the bus stop who looked like they were spectators, and they were also confused. We ended up walking from there, but I [jogged](https://www.strava.com/activities/11339266869) since I needed to get to the start line with some time to spare. During the jog I could tell that my muscles were really tight, which didn't give me a lot of confidence about how the race would do go. I still made it to the start area around 8:15. I stood in line at one of the porta-potties and did my dynamic warm-up routine while waiting. I just made it out of there at 8:28 and rushed over to the start line while gobbling down on my Honey Stinger Waffle and taking a bit of insulin since my blood sugar was already a bit high. Unfortunately, I hastily got into the start line area wherever I could, and I ended up 3 or 4 corrals after the first. I tried as hard as I could to squeeze between people as politely as possible to try and get to my corral. Unfortunately I just missed it, so I ended up being at the front of the 2nd corral, which was fine given what my final time was; I just wish I hadn't wasted energy trying to rush to the front around everyone.\n\n### Race\n\n#### 1-6\n\nI started feeling pretty strong, but I also know that my HR takes some time to go up when I start my runs, so I knew I would get cocky in the beginning. My dynamic warm up helped loosen up my glutes and hips, which I was worried about when I jogged to the start line, but immediately when the run started I could feel tightness in my hamstring. Not a great sign but I tried not to focus on it and accept that it's race time so I'll just have to do my best.\n\nI was worried about the hills going in because I didn't do a lot of hill training, and I suck at running down hills. I understand that I simultaneously shouldn't run downhill too quickly to avoid bonking later on, but I also need to use the steady downhills to make up for the time I was going to lose on the climb at Cambie. I went to my physio a few weeks before the race and told her about how I feel tightness in my knee when I run downhill; she helped make adjustments and gave me exercises to do to help my knee feel more comfortable on downhills; they definitely helped, but I still don't have the right technique for running downhill optimally in a way that doesn't cause me to waste energy slowing myself down. I was a little bit ahead of pace by the time I got to the dreaded hill.\n\n#### 7-13\n\nThe hill obviously sucked, but that was expected. It was stressful to go slow and have my heart rate go so high, but I tried to keep a consistent cadence going up. At the top of the hill I had a hard time bringing my HR down while maintaining a decent pace. It looks like it took me a few miles after the sharp ascent before I got back to target pace. My hamstring hurting didn't help with this. \n\nThe scenery was beautiful and hearing all the positivity around me helped keep my spirits up. After having a gel and trying to pick up the pace a bit I could feel my stomach starting to rumble, so I took one of my gravols and slowed down. I figured they take time to have effect so I wanted to take them early.\n\nI spent a lot of the race alone, which was nice when I would pass by spectators calling my name. It was nice to hear people cheering me on and comment how I wasn't even breaking a sweat. There was a jazz band playing before we arrived at UBC which was awesome to hear.\n\nRight before the halfway mark was a steep downhill. I tried my best to avoid speeding up too much because there was still a lot of race to go. The views of the mountains at the turn were beautiful.\n\n#### 14-21\n\nI started feeling a bit discouraged because my heart rate was in the 170s even though I wasn't going too fast, but my legs were still hurting from the beginning. I read online about how the Burrard Street bridge is brutal and the part of the race where many people hit the wall, so my mind was entirely on that. I also asked my friends to be at the bridge; they already had to go downtown at 9am to see the half marathoners finish and to get one of the people staying with us to his 8k start line at 9:30am. I didn't check my phone during the race but I would see Whatsapp notifications pop up on my watch, and it gave me motivation to see that they were on the way, and also comment on how fast I was going :)\n\nI don't think I had trouble going through the bridge, which motivated me. I also saw a notification saying \"we are at the end of the bridge\" so I was prepared for that. I saw my friends, gave them a high five, and picked up my pace probably a bit too much 😅\n\nI felt strong going into Stanley Park, but read about how it could be brutal, and was nervous about my HR being in the high 170s already.\n\n#### 21 - Finish\n\nI was mentally prepared for Stanley Park. I was expecting it to be completely dead, but that was not the case for the first half of the Seawall with the aid and cheer stations. The second-half was definitely quiet, but I had my Shokz on playing some music that was fitting for the scenery (Amenra and Septicflesh). It was a bit hard to pick up the pace as the course was a bit tight but I was able to do so. I saw some bloodshed though; one woman was completely covered in a foil blanket with a vested individual standing over her on his phone, one man on a bench with his arm dangling who may have been unresponsive, with some staff rushing back in his direction after I passed him, and one person who started cramping, moved to the side yelling \"Fuck!\" I yelled at him \"You got his!\" but immediately realized that maybe those weren't the right words for someone who was cramping up. Not sure what I should have said, though. I started cramping up a tiny bit, my pump was complaining that my blood sugar was dropping, and so I decided to take a gel because I figured it had some electrolytes, and it had been a half hour since my last one. In retrospect I think perhaps a salt tab would have been more useful, but I didn't want to do anything new on race day, even if I only had just over a mile left.\n\nAfter we left Stanley Park, I felt fine enough to kick up the pace. I saw my friends during the finish and they got some great pictures of me. I was disappointed at how close I was to not PB'ing but at least I reached that milestone. Finishing strong had me feeling like I was holding back elsewhere during the race.\n\n### Post-race\n\nI got my medal and felt fine walking to bag check. I picked up a banana and a bottle of the fancy bottled water on the way. I felt sad passing by the sandwiches I couldn't eat. There were also bags of chips that I feel really stupid for skipping. For some reason I scanned the bag for a GF label, but I found out a week later that the brand they had was gluten-free: the GF logo was on the top left, and for some reason I didn't check there. \n\nI passed by a change tent on the way, so I went back there after getting my bag. I put on my hoodie, while bending down to take off my shoes my right adductor started cramping very intensely. I asked someone who was sitting close to me if I could steal their chair and I sat down. I text my friends letting them know I'm in the tent but had a crazy cramp and so was going to take some time to get up. I munched on the banana I had and took a salt cap that I thankfully still had on me. It felt like it took forever but it was probably only 10 minutes until I was able to stand up and lean against a table again to continue putting on my joggers and sandals. It was raining lightly, which was a bit annoying since I was wearing socks with sandals, but it wasn't too heavy. I met up with my friends, got some pictures, and we headed out.\n\n*Unfortunately*, one of my friends in the group was made aware on Little Red Book that the Lululemon stores downtown had a deal for that day only to get 20% off our purchase if you show your medal/bib. We ended up going to Lululemon 3 times because I'm bad at saying no, so it took a while to get home. We did go to Nuba in Yaletown for lunch which was really good. That night we went to East is East for dinner, which was nice, though in hindsight I should have realized that the loud music made it not the best choice when what I wanted was to feel relaxed and cozy.\n\nWe stayed in Vancouver for an extra week and we flew back on the 12th. It was a wonderful stay and I felt depressed coming back. I wish I could have gone on more hikes and even gone trail running through all the beautiful trails in the area.\n\n### Retrospective\n\n* I think I ran too conservatively because I was worried about stomach issues (valid given the morning). I needed more electrolytes, though. Overall the race felt easier than Toronto, so it was frustrating that I didn't get a bit closer to my goal time.\n* I also wonder how I would have performed if I ran slower in the first half. I know that's the recommendation, but part of me felt like slowing down on some of the downhills would have required me to adjust my form and engage muscles in a way that could have wasted energy. Something to consider for next time, though.\n* I wore half tights this time as I had issues with my shorts falling down too much in Toronto. Surprisingly I had that issue this time too! I guess it's a combination of my race belt weighing my shorts down (maybe I should wear it higher?), the weight of Larabars, phone, and pump in my shorts weighing them down (I'm pretty sure I trained like this though), and me losing over 7 lbs in training that caused this. Not sure what I'll do for the next race beyond do more practice in race gear to see what adjustments I need to make. \n* I feel like I didn't do a lot of speed work this time around, and any time I did anaerobic runs my adductor would be very sore, so I need to improve my strength there and really build up my speed again. I also need to focus on how I breathe when working hard instead of worrying about breathing in through my mouth too much. My watch would cancel out speed workouts often times because of my lack of sleep and because of my bike commutes and volleyball sessions, so I need to start planning out my own workouts instead of being too much of a slave to my watch's suggestions.\n* I'll stop using Kinvara 13s as speed shoes; I'll wear them for some easy runs maybe, or even transition them to daily walkers/gym shoes. I have the Endorphin Speed 3s for speed work now. I also got a pair of Kinvara 14s from Winners for about $50, and the increased cushioning in them might be less likely to cause excessive soreness after doing fast intervals.\n* I liked eating Larabars for energy. I am considering continuing with that and also perhaps making my own gels (mostly maple syrup, ginger, salt, and lemon juice is what I'm thinking, perhaps with some chia seeds or subbing for honey) to bring in reusable containers to reduce waste, perhaps be more appealing to consume even without water, and produce less waste/stickiness. Gels also get pricey, it's annoying that Huma's + gels with electrolytes aren't available locally here, and I figure less refined sources of energy would be better than processed foods.\n* I want to do dedicated hill and/or trail workouts; I should set time for myself to bike to an area close by to do those as they are fun and will definitely improve my fitness\n* There are a few places in Toronto that do Hot/Cold therapy (Othership and Alter) I've been meaning to check out for almost a year. I need to stop being lazy and shy about it and just go because I think it's something I'll like, although I would probably only go once a month considering how much it costs.\n* After my last marathon I felt regret that my legs were sore before the race. I tried to fix that this time but wasn't successful. I guess walking to/from work on Friday, then walking with my luggage to the train station and then walking a lot in the airport to get to the gate contributed to that. I went to the expo the next day intending not to spend too much time there, but I was with a group and the people I was with wanted to spend time at a lot of the tables so I ended up on my feet for longer than I probably should have been. I should probably also review the training I do on the last week and maybe consider not even walking to work or biking around town for errands to try and conserve myself more.\n* My sleep habits are shit. I watched the Running Channel's [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPaADgbztqE) on recovering after the London Marathon and Sarah's watch showed that she would casually get over 8 hours and have a sleep score of 90, which is unimaginable to me 😭. I need to change that and intend to do so immediately.\n* On the one hand I should prioritize getting to the start line earlier, but I also want to leave as late as possible to avoid having to depend on a crowded port-a-potty. I think this would not have been an issue if my stomach wasn't upset that morning.\n* I want to get a running form analysis done. There are a lot of places around me that offer that service and I can get it partially covered under my physio benefits through work. \n\n### Looking Forward\n\nI definitely feel like I can PB by a significant margin if I have more discipline in my training, sleep better, and avoid the race day issues I faced. I am still deciding where to do a Fall marathon though. I am trying to weight between what would be a fun race, what would be a good place to travel to and stay  for some time after the race, and what would not be too tough of a course. I'm considering the following so far:\n\n* Loch Ness Marathon\n  * + I've seen it recommended here a lot, and the Scottish Highlands look beautiful.\n  * + Traveling to Europe is nice because it's easy to travel elsewhere on the continent if I do an extended stay before heading back\n  * - International travel could make it harder to have an ideal race day, and reading race reports make me nervous about how I may have to take an early bus and stand around the start line for a long time\n  * - I'm not sure how good public transit in the area would be since it's rural compared to big cities. I don't like driving if I don't have to and I don't like to use taxis or rideshare\n* St George, UT\n  * + Downhill marathon, although I think I would prefer a flat marathon as that seems like it would be technically easier unless the decline was light. \n  * + I want to explore the southwest canyons as I've never been and it would be fun to explore the hikes in the area afterwards assuming recovery isn't a problem\n  * - Presumably no shade since it's down a canyon\n  * - Would need a car to get everywhere. Traveling to this area would be for doing a lot of active things but if I give it my all during a marathon it could feel like an incomplete experience.\n* Malaga Marathon\n  * + Popular flat marathon\n  * + Love Spain, but didn't visit Malaga when I went last year. Lots of gluten free food in the area\n  * + It's in December, which gives me a lot of time to train and knock out some half marathons in the meantime\n  * - I suck at traveling to places where I don't speak the language due to social anxiety. This could be a good way to help get over that and work on it, though.\n  * - It being late means it could be a good candidate for a backup marathon in case a primary marathon doesn't go well for whatever reason\n* Victoria, BC\n  * + BC is beautiful. I wouldn't have to worry about language barriers, and this is a place I would be down to stay for some time after the race.\n  * + The race is well-rated for beauty\n  * - While not too difficult, the race has a lot of rolling hills, so it will be mildly technical the whole way through\n  * - Maybe too similar to Vancouver? Should I prioritize traveling somewhere else instead of doing another week-long BC trip?\n  \n\nUpcoming local races I'm signed up for are a 10k in June by the waterfront, and a 10k in September on the Toronto Island. I would like to see how close I can get to 40 minutes if I wore my Endorphin Speed 3s. I'm hoping to pick training back up this week, but not ramp up too quickly.\n\nI also want to sign up for trail races because trail running is fun. It's unfortunate how it's hard to participate without relying on a car, though.\n\nI may do the Presidio Half Marathon in San Francisco at the end of June; I was offered free registration so long as I record and upload the race as I did for the San Francisco Marathon; it looks like flights to the area area bit pricey at this time though, so even if I stay with a friend it might be a bit too much right now. \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

My main form of exercise prior to this was pick-up basketball a couple days a week, which for those of you who know ball, mainly involves short sprints with periods of standing around (obviously I should be crashing the boards more). A friend invited me to run the Eugene Marathon (our hometown race) with him and on a whim I said yes. How hard could it be? Unbeknownst to me, really freaking hard. \n\n\nMy training block started in December with no formal training plan. I took a look at all the various recommended plans, from Hanson's to Pfitz 18/55, and loosely based my training on a mishmash of these. Ultimately I ended up averaging 20-40 miles per week, usually with one or two easy runs, one speed session, one tempo run, and one long run. I realize that this is lowish mileage, but it was all I could honestly pull off with three kids and a demanding job. I spent the first weeks just getting used to running, figuring out what good running form is supposed to be, how to tackle track workouts, how to interpret my Garmin data, and assembling some sort of a shoe rotation. I didn't have a time goal in mind at first, but as my running fitness slowly revealed itself, I made an arbitrary goal of sub-3:30. Ambitious for a first marathon, but according to my metrics theoretically obtainable.\n\n\nTraining went well and I was able to avoid injury. I ended up completing three long runs of 20, 20, and 21 miles each, each with a good amount of marathon pace (7:50) miles. Looking back, this may not have been optimal since about 40-50% of my weekly mileage was concentrated in these long runs, leading to longer recovery times afterwards. I practiced with Maurten gels, found them easy to handle, and decided to stick with them for race day. Turns out that I can handle more affordable gels too (more on that later), so maybe I'll change things up for the next training block. Strength training was sprinkled in haphazardly, mostly doing upper body work because my legs would be tired. This would come back to mildly haunt me during the race. In any case, training felt like it went relatively smoothly, though I would in retrospect add in some more hill work. \n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nTapered for a couple weeks before race day, which felt very odd. I was getting all sorts of weird aches and pains that I hadn't experienced before, and the runs that I did ended up feeling pretty sluggish. I may experiment with a shorter (7-10 day) taper in the future to see if it feels any different. Carb loaded the week before just by trying to eat more rice, pasta, and bread, but didn't try to count grams. Honestly, I love carb loading, it felt fantastic to eat a bunch of carbs when I had been trying to avoid it to stave off the dad-bod in the past few years. \n\n\nEugene being my hometown race, it was pretty nice to sleep in my own bed the night before. I did wake up in a cold sweat at 4AM because I had an incredibly vivid nightmare that I woke up at 7:05 and missed the start, that was real fun. Ate a bagel with peanut butter, bananas, and honey, drank my customary cup of coffee, evacuated the bowels, and caught a ride to the race with a buddy who I was running with. I have no other races to compare this with, but Eugene felt like a really well organized race, with tons of portapotties, volunteers, and quick gear check. Pre-race went without a hitch and we made it into Corral B about 15 minutes before the start. I had no idea it was going to be that crowded, but it was fun chatting with the people around us as we tried to stay warm. The announcer counted us down, and off we went!\n\n### Race\nMiles 1-13\n\n \nThis being my first marathon, I kind of knew to expect a crowded start, but I wasn't fully prepared for exactly how crowded it would be. I ended up trying to keep to the edges to try and maintain my pace, but that did lead to some weaving and jumping over curbs/puddles/potholes, which may have come back to bite me later in the race. The first few miles of the race went reasonably well as I tried to keep to my planned pace of 7:40-7:50 min/mile and I felt fine. I stuck to my fueling strategy of a Maurten 100 every 30 minutes, alternating between regular and caf gels. I also tried to grab Nuun drink and down it while running - I quickly figured out after the first station that I would just end up aspirating half of the drink and have a violent coughing fit. I'd end up walking and drinking the rest of the stations. The crowds were amazing and I found myself smiling and waving to nearly every spectator that I ran by, especially the ones with hilarious signs. There was a long gradual uphill early on, which didn't really give me any problems, and then a much steeper but shorter hill afterwards that I tried to take slowly. I have naturally high turnover (cadence 180-190 usually) and I found myself really rocketing down the declines as I tried to make a conscious effort to not brake with my heels. This caused me to take the downhills at a stupid pace (6:15-6:30) and probably came back to hurt me later in the race. In retrospect, braking on the downhills is probably necessary in order to maintain a reasonable pace and save my quads. The Springfield section saw us running down a couple major roads by some construction, which was a little bit of a drag. But then I saw my wife, kids, and some friends cheering wildly after turning off of Main Street and that gave me a huge boost. Couldn't wipe the stupid smile off my face as we headed back towards Alton Baker. \n\n\n\n\n\nMiles 14-21 \n\nThis was a section of the race that was a little sparser on the crowds, which made it feel tougher. In addition, as I reached to grab my gel for mile 16, I realized that one of my caf gels had fallen out of my half-tights, which sent me into a minor panic. Thankfully, the course had 3 gel stations interspersed throughout the course, which would ultimately save me. That being said, the mental burden of having my fueling strategy thrown off was hard to shake. I ended up involuntarily slowing down my pace at miles 17-19 as I felt my legs slow down, which had never happened to me before during long training runs. I believe that much of this was purely mental, since I had stuck to my fueling up to that point, and we were on the river path which little to no crowd support. At mile 19 I saw my family again, which gave me another big boost and I felt like I was able to pick up my pace again. I also was able to grab a Gu from an aid station and choked it down. Having only trained with Maurtens, the Gu's thick consistency threw me for a loop - I felt like I was eating a chocolate pudding. Not a fan. Still, it gave me enough energy to pick up the pace for a couple of miles. A friend who was aiming for the same time goal caught up to me and we ran together for the rest of this section, which was a godsend. My legs were still turning over, but they were starting to feel heavier and I felt like it was getting tougher to maintain a sub-8:00 pace.  \n\n\n \nMiles 22-26.2 \n\nThis was where things got hard. Most of this was still on the river path, which was very familiar territory since I had trained almost all my long runs on this path. Knowing what to expect maybe gave me a slight mental advantage, but the fact remained that my legs were feeling heavy and my breathing was started to get more ragged. My running buddy eventually cramped up at mile 23 and had to drop back to stretch, meanwhile I trucked on, focusing on trying to keep my legs moving. Around mile 24 I felt my left calf start to spasm and I had to back off on pace to prevent a full cramp. At mile 25 my right hamstring started to do the same, and then my left hamstring. I was somehow able to keep my legs turning but I felt like I was on the razor's edge between running and having full-blown cramps. I saw lots of people pulled off to the side trying to stretch and I shouted encouragement as best as I could. As we got out of the trees and onto the street towards Hayward, the crowd thickened and their cheering pushed me onwards. I tried to pick up the pace, but immediately felt my hamstrings spasming so I backed off. Finally, rounding into Hayward was amazing, with all the spectators in the stands cheering us on. I saw my kids at the front row, cheering wildly and waving their signs, and it gave me some impetus to push myself to a \"sprint\" to the finish line. I knew I had finished under my 3:30 goal, but had no idea how far under I was. It wasn't until I pulled up the official chip time later that I saw my final time of 3:26:57. I did it! I waited around for some other friends to finish, and we hobbled off of the field together. \n\n \n### Post-race\n\nFound my family and gave them all huge hugs - having never had run an official marathon before, I had no idea how much of a boost I would get from seeing them. I had previously thought that running was almost purely physical, and it would be impossible to push past physicial limits that were defined by your training. But somehow at the end, even though I was on the brink of cramping, I was able to pick up my pace and sprint to the end. I had to attribute that to seeing my kids at the finish line.  \n\nOverall I was really happy with my results, especially given my relatively low weekly mileage in training and it being my first marathon. I can't say that I have ever known such physical suffering as I felt in miles 22-26, but it felt great to be able to push through that pain and finish relatively strong. I've been bitten by the running bug and I've already signed up for the next one!\n\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph"

I started running in August of 2021 specifically to do a marathon, crossed the finish line that December and since then it’s been an addiction. I’ve now run 4 marathons, 2 50k, 3 70.3s, a full Ironman and in February as I switched from Triathlon to Ultras I did my first 50 miler. The 50 (in spite of showing I need to fix some blister issues) confirmed for me that ultra events are my favorite. I still like the triathlon training and how I feel with those more, but as far as events and culture, ultras are my thing. So anyway, I know I’m now an ultra runner, but I was a little lost as to what my next “A” race would be. I had the option of Ironman in October, Rio Del Lago 100 miler in November, or one of these backyard ultras that I’ve been hearing about. For those that are unaware, it’s basically a 4.2(ish) mile loop that is done every hour. No matter how fast or slow you run that loop, every hour on the hour another loop starts. This goes until people drop off and there is one person left. At the surface, this seemed like something that I’d like to inject directly into my veins. But that could just be me being naïve about how boring doing the same loop over and over would be, or how much I HATE stopping during runs. But the main draw for me, is that within 15 minutes of any race I’ve ever run in my life, the eventual winner is nowhere near me. Lining up every hour with the eventual winner and looking them in the eye just gets me irrationally hyped. That said, I’m coming off my first 50 miler, my toes are still healing (waiting on my big toe nail to fall off at this point, and my coach has BEGGED me to not go too deep in the well for this one. He wants a real training build up, some time to figure out blister issues and be legitimately prepared for a race. So the main goal here is to see if I want to throw 6 months of specific training at a race of this format.\n\n \n\nRace Day:\n\nSo there are only 3 people signed up for this race. We even got an email from the race director asking if we still wanted to race. I get there with my wife, 3 kids and parents with tents, pop-ups, battery packs and iPads ready for this to be a long day. I have Maurten gels for 24 hours, huge packs of electrolyte mixes, I have my headlamp in case this goes into the night, 7 pairs of socks, 3 pairs of shoes, I have my heat gear, a tent, pop-up and a table. Quite frankly I may have had as much setup as the race director. My Bi-Carb and Ketones get drunk, we’re ready to rock.\n\n \n\nCourse:\n\nThis course was very strange. We’re out in the middle of farm land, and the first 1.7 miles is all exposed and it got up to 90 degrees at the peak of the day. What made it worse was a good mile of this section was not mowed, so we were trying to pave a path through calf high grass in places. After that you get to a legitimate trail that has a good bit of tree cover. One tiny hill for a grand total of 30 feet of elevation gain on the loop, so it’s pancake flat. There’s also a street crossing where there are a couple volunteers pressing the button to stop any cars coming by. Not a super busy street, so it was never a huge issue, but I did laugh a bit every time.\n\n \n\nRace:\n\n8am rolls around and I meet the two other people I’m running with. One guy just turned 33 so his goal was to do that many miles. Another is a woman in her 50s who had about the same goal for the day, but she was training for a run from the bottom of the UK to the top over 35 days or something. She’s done the Tahoe 200 before (something that’s on my bucket list), and I’m definitely a bit intimidated. That said, she says she has tickets for a comedy show later tonight, so I jokingly say I just need to hold out until she has to leave for that. Race starts and we decide we should run together a bit for the first lap just to figure out where the hell we’re going. We universally agree that the first section is BS, but the shade after makes all the difference. I start walking at the shade and let them run up ahead. I see them later on when I finish my loop.\n\nMy goal was to hit 50 to 55 minutes on each loop. First and foremost I don’t want to be sitting too long and thinking about pain or heat or whatever. To do this, I go at an easy pace for the heat section, walk when I get to the shade until I get to a 13 minute pace or so. Then I start running again. When I get to the tiny hill I start walking again until the pace drops in that range and then run into the finish line. I think I pegged every single lap right around 53 minutes. I’d grab a sponge from the ice bucket and wipe down my arms, sit down, eat my gel, put some ice in the pouch on my back, in my hat and down my pants. Every 2 laps I’d change socks and spray my feet down with Aquaphor to keep them lubricated. Every 4^(th) lap I’d change shoes. I’d eat fruit or any snacks I was feeling while my dad would fill my water bottles, one with electrolyte mix and one with regular water. I’d usually get up from the seat between the 2 and 1 minute warning, mosey on over to the start line, sponge down my arms one last time and get ready to do it again.\n\nLoops 1 and 2 are about the same. I send a check in text as I’m walking in the shade to my wife and coach which I call my “\\*.5 check in.” I grade my pace, attitude, pain level and fun being had with any notes.\n\nOn loop 2.5 I text that the young guy is struggling in the heat. I even texted my wife to have the race director check on him when I didn’t see him for a while, but he was ok. I talked to him a bit and he said he was using too much energy running the heat section so he was walking some of it. I figured that would be too much heat exposure for me, but he says he’s ok.\n\nLoop 3.5 I am getting too much sweat in my eyes. I usually wear an American flag headband when I run, but in the heat (and with my thinning hair up top prone to sunburn) I’ve switched away to a bucket hat. Until now I had the headband on the outside of the bucket hat. I admit I’m choosing fashion/superstition over practicality and put the headband under the hat which immediately fixes the problem. I also have a fun conversation with the woman about how I’m doing this whole mathematical calculation for my pace which makes sense being a CPA. She says she’s running completely on feel, but that makes sense because she’s a massage therapist. The young guy struggles a lot and comes in at 57 minutes on lap 4 and drops.\n\nLoop 4.5 I have made my first shoe switch. After wearing the Altras with the wide toe box the Hokas that I’ve run all my other races in feel horribly constricting and I have a good idea of why I keep getting blisters. I decide to change shoes back to the Altras after this lap. Woman says her goal is 4 more laps.\n\nLoop 5.5 I write that she’s trying to mind game me and that she’s gone a bit negative and I need to be more positive to combat it. Now I know that this probably says a lot more about me than it does her. It’s possible and even likely that she was dancing at the start line of loop 6 because she liked the song. But in my head, in that minute it seemed like she was trying to show no weakness. She starts off that lap a little hot, but I keep my same pace. The surprising part is when I pass her about halfway through the heat section and it takes her a bit to catch up as I’m walking in the shade. She grumbles a bit about that section of uncut grass and asks how long I’m going and what happens if we both stop at the same time. Just some little cracks mentally that I note as she starts running again up ahead of me. Now usually at this point I don’t see her until the finish line because she’s been running 46 minute laps and I’ve been well behind at 53 minute laps. But midway through my walk section I see her just a little up ahead at a turn. Please know, I AM NOT PROUD of what happens next. It’s not time to run yet, but with her struggling a little bit, I bet that if I pass her she breaks. So I start running, and make sure to keep my breathing and heart rate in check. I run by, say “I’m gonna hustle on this one, I want a burrito.” This is not a lie, I did indeed want a burrito and when I came in the announcer asked how I was feeling to which I responded, “feels like half-time” as I had just finished 25 miles. Well half way into my burrito they tell me she’s going to drop. She congratulates me and I just have to finish my last lap to win. Yes, I mind-gamed a woman in her 50s to win. Now is she a badass woman in her 50s? Damn right she is. She’s done races I can only dream about right now, and I probably do it again given the chance. She later tells my dad that she asked herself what the hell she was doing once I passed her.\n\nI decide lap 7 should be really strong, so I take off and do the heat section in sub 9 minute pace. This was a bad call. I decide my ego isn’t that big and walk in the shade a bit so I don’t pass out. I finish in about 49 minutes, get a cool sweatshirt, [which I then proceed to wear](https://imgur.com/a/gA6hjIX) in spite of the heat for pictures with my kids on a makeshift podium because I never have and probably never will win another race in my life.\n\n \n\nPost-race:\n\nA few small blisters. One of which is on my heel which is new, but as of Monday they’re already minimal, so 30 miles in that is a huge improvement from normal. I’m on the right track but still stuff to figure out. With the system I had I didn’t mind the stops at all in this race format. I also think my superpower is doing boring things over and over again, so the loop didn’t bother me at all. It’s almost certainly something I’m going to be throwing 6 months of training at for a big showing in November. Had a fun day with some really enjoyable people. Plus my coach didn’t yell at me for going too deep and this will be a quick recovery into some real training blocks. Overall loved it!",

I haven't run a full marathon in 2 years, at which time I ran a 3:46, but then I ran a 1:29 half marathon last year and figured if I trained hard enough I could get my half marathon below 1:25 and full under 3 hours.\n\nThis was my tune up race, and going into it I was a little nervous as not all of my uptempo runs have been going to plan, and in the last couple weeks I have had the additional issues of needing to poop any time I'm trying to get down nutrition, which I use Gus and liquid IV for. I have used these for years so for them to be causing issues now is odd. I have also run this race the last two years, in which I got a 1:48 (bonked), then a 1:27, so today's goal of 1:22 was a big step in the right direction if I could manage it.\n\nStill, I knew I could beat my old record by a lot, and I did some research on the entrants to see where I stand. My goal was 6:37 pace, or 1:22, and I knew there was a pack of 2-3 people who all run similar paces but a little faster, so I decided if they kept the pace over 6:30/mile I would hang on.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nGot up early, ate my oatmeal, drank my coffee, did a bunch of stretching and a moblility routine, then headed over to the race to talk with others and get hyped up. The weather was in the 40s with overcast and barely any wind. My race kit consisted of:\n\nShoes: Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris Shorts: Janji AFO 5\" with additional Path Projects liner to help with any possible thigh chafing. Shirt: Asics Actibreeze Singlet Hat: Janji Ultralight\n\n# Race\n\n**1st 5K - 20:15**\n\nThe race started out hot, but our pack of 4 cooled it down in the first quarter mile, still starting out a little hot in the first mile but then we chilled out and the rest of the first 5K felt good. It's crazy to me that this pace honestly felt easy, when going under 6:40 during my workouts always was a struggle. The adrenaline and running with a pack really does something.\n\n**2nd 5K - 20:18; 1st 10K - 40:33**\n\nMostly boring, ran it very even, got my first aid from my wife at my 4 and then hit the first aid station at 5.5, both of which caused a tiny bit of upset in my stomach, but not like normal.\n\n**3rd 5K - 20:26**\n\nWe dropped one of the 4 of our pack at this point, so now it's down to 3 of us, but I was sitting behind the two of them for the most part. We hit the final turn around shortly after mile 8, and I told myself once we get to mile 9 I would try to bump up the pace. So I moved past them to 6:25 pace shortly after hitting that but then the other 2 came back even stronger at 6:20 pace and left me in the dust. I could always see them but they were fading away as the time ticked on, even though I was still going under 6:30.\n\n**4th 5K - 19:35; 2nd 10K - 40:01**\n\nThis is where the real race began. At this point I usually couldn't see them, but there was a huge section of downhill around mile 11 that I decided to take advantage. I could finally see them and saw that I was covering the gap and by the time I got to the bottom of the hill I had caught up and they seemed very surprised. This course is incredibly flat, but the last mile has 3 small up and down hills that test the grit in each runner. I pushed up each of those hills harder than the previous. I figured I had dropped one of the guys, but the other was hot at my heels. I could hear him behind me, but then we made the final turn to the home stretch which is about a quarter mile and I just booked it, finally unable to hear him as I ended up winning by about 5 seconds. I wasn't looking at my watch the final 2 miles, so I was surprised to see that I hit my 12th mile in 6:13 and final .43 miles at 5:50 pace (with the final stretch getting into 5:20 territory).\n\n# Post-race\n\nI felt elated! I beat my goal by a lot, I got to have a proper fun race with some challenging competitors who also gave it their all, and while I was tired my body was fairly ready to go not long after and I was able to enjoy the post race fun with friends back at home sitting out in the sun in our backyard. I came into this not knowing whether I was ready for this race or Grandma's marathon in June, but I feel much more confident that if 6:30 pace felt easy for 12 miles, 6:52 will hopefully feel alright for over double that. The work has just started, now to stick with the plan for the remaining 6 weeks."

So far this has worked out pretty well for me. I started with running around 3 years ago and last year I entered and finished my first three races and hit my goals each time (10 miles in sub 1:20, 10k in sub 45, 10k in sub 44).\n\n\nThis means I run quite a lot, but the variety of workouts isn't huge. I finished last year with 3'000 km in total with my longest runs being somewhere above 30 km. I didn't really want to do any major changes when training for my first marathon so I thought I would just more or less train like I did before.\n\n\nI had a wisdom teeth removal in February which sidelined me for 1 week. That wasn't ideal, but definitely no big deal.\n\n\nUnfortunately I found out a few weeks later that I had a hernia which required me to have surgery. The surgery was scheduled towards the middle of march. At this point I feared I wouldn't be able to enter the race at all but my doctor gave me hope by not ruling it out completely. I was still able to run until the surgery took place, but after that I had to take off at least two weeks completely (by my doctors advice) and I absolutely wasn't able to continue where I left off after that. After my \"comeback\" in early April I ran consistently again but I didn't want to do too much too soon so I started slowly. I think I only did one  \"longish\" run after that which was about 18k.\n\n\nI also did some testing with fueling during that time so I hopefully wouldn't throw up or something. I'm not a fan of gels and stuff like that so I just decided to eat some medjool dates during runs which worked out pretty well during training.\n\n### Pre-race\nI spent probably around 10 hours in the train last weekend because I had to pick up my bib on saturday and then show up to the actual race on saturday with each trip taking 4+ hours.\n\n\nThis really allowed me to realise how bad my training has been for a race like this and that I was probably underestimating the distance up to that point. Still, there was no turning back now so I got up around 5am on sunday to travel to Geneva.\n\n### Race\nThe start went pretty well, nothing special to notice here. I kind of followed the 3:30:00 pacemaker and ate a date every 30 minutes or so. So far so good. I really started to feel my feet in a bad way around the 15k mark or so. In hindsight I should've probably used a different shoe. I used my tempo workout shoe, the Asics Magic Speed 3. I'm sure a lot of people have used this shoe sucessfully for marathons, but for me it's probably too firm for anything beyond 10 miles or so.\n\n\nAround the same time I also started to feel uncomfortable being stuck in the pack around the 03:30:00 pacemaker. In hindsight I should've probably dropped back, but I decided to overtake him and hoped I would be able to stay there. Unfortunately my feet problems got worse and worse (not that surprising lol) and I was also feeling pretty cooked in general.\n\n\nSomewhere after 30k I heard very loud footsteps behind me and I knew this was the 03:30:00 group I foolishly ran away from before lol. I made way for them and I didn't even try to keep up. The goal wasn't sub 3:30 anymore, it was to finish without walking.\n\n\nThe next 10k were kind of a blur. I remember seeing my family who came to watch me around the 35k mark which really motivated me. As you can see by my splits, I had to fall back to my easy pace during that stretch. The audience in general was very motivating during the last 5k and I really needed that at this point. Around the 40k mark I was starting to feel pretty hopeful about being able to finish the race with an ok time. I really didn't want another pacemaker to overtake me lol.\n\n\nFortunately that worked out so I finished the race in 03:36:39.\n\n### Post-race\nI met my family at the finish line, they were happy for me and I was feeling pretty positive about the race as well even though I failed to reach my initial goal. I was kind of shocked when I looked at my shoes because they were bloody. It probably wouldn't have been visible if I wore different shoes, but considering the Magic Speed 3 are white with a very thin upper, it wasn't looking pretty lol.\n\n\nI finished the race with 2 out of the 6 medjool dates I took with me. Idk if this counts as underfueling, but I really didn't feel like I hit the wall in the classical sense.\n\n\nOverall this was a very interesting journey. It kind of sucks knowing that I was probably in sub 3:30 shape last year (at least according to my garmin race prediction which has been surprisingly accurate for me) before I regressed due to non running related injuries.\n\n\nI'll probably take another shot at a marathon in the future even though it was pretty painful, but I really want to get that sub 3:30:00 sooner or later.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

I've been running just a little over 4 years now, and  I've been pretty casual about the whole thing, but even then, running has really helped out my quality of life. I'm way less tired and as far as working as a videographer goes, I find I'm able to stay on my feet for an entire shoot day without much trouble now.\n\nTo give you an idea of my fitness going in, my 5K PB is 18:51 and my 10K PB was hovering around 42 minutes. My longest run in terms of distance was 30km and that was completed in about 3:15:00.\n\nI never really gave the thought of races, let alone a marathon, much consideration. The closest I've gotten to that was filming a 10K race for work, but after watching the anime Run With The Wind, I got inspired and wanted to challenge myself.\n\nInitially, I didn't want to do this great big write up, but after having a week to reflect on the race, I thought I should give something back to this sub, since it's helped me on my running journey.\n\n# Training\n\nI signed up with 14 weeks to go. I was under a bit of a time crunch here, and was caught a bit off guard by how lengthy some of the marathon running plans were, as well as how low-mileage some of them started off. It didn't really make sense to me to suddenly cut my mileage so drastically, when I was already essentially at the middle point of most plans with my usual training regimen. I didn't have any doubt as to whether I could finish, it'd just be a matter of how fast I could do it. In the end, I decided I know my body best, and judged that I could truncate some of the training given my fitness level. My training plan ended up being nearly identical to what I was doing prior to sign up, but there were additional considerations to be made, particularly around the long easy runs on Saturday, and a taper period at the end.\n\nMonday - an easy 12.5km zone 2 run mixed in with some light speed work, followed by some plyometric exercises. Box jumps, depth jumps, and resistance band exercises. After a few injuries during the last summer, I realized I needed to increase my leg strength to avoid further injury.\n\nTuesday - an easy 12.5km zone 2 run.\n\nWednesday - speed work. Alternating weekly between a 12.5km tempo run (2.5km warm up, 10km fast) and 10 x 800m intervals.\n\nThursday - 30km on a stationary bike at a moderate pace. After the hard day, I thought it'd be nice to give my joints a bit of a rest.\n\nFriday - an easy 15km zone 2 run.\n\nSaturday - a long easy run. Alternating between a half marathon and 30km. After 6 weeks, I'd switch over to 30km exclusively and ramp that up to 35km.\n\nSunday - rest. If time permitted, a warm bath.\n\nAs a disclaimer, the above is what worked for me. Please listen to your body and train within your limits. I'm definitely no running coach, and I definitely don't want to come across as prescriptive in this post.\n\nWork got in the way at times, but I did my best to keep to my plan. No injuries whatsoever, but the main thing I was worried about was the weather. A lot of my training was done on the treadmill, since southern Ontario weather tends to be wet and cold this time of year. If not downright snowy and icy. While the treadmill is an excellent way to maintain fitness during winter months, it's not quite the same as running outside. What's more, I wasn't acclimating to the colder temperatures I'd be running in. It was about 25 to 30C in the room where I keep the treadmill and it'd be an estimated 2-15C on race day. I took every chance I could to go outside during February and March, but it wasn't until April that I could properly go outside.\n\nComing to grips with lower temperature running took a lot of trial and error. I experimented with a lot of clothing configurations. I often found I was overdressing and ended up sweating loads. What helped was a comment on this sub. The guideline was to dress for how you'd go for a walk on a day that's 10C warmer than race day. For example, if it were 4C, then I'd dress for 14C, which would mean long sleeves and a light coat. Speaking of dressing, I would also take most of the easy runs with what I would be carrying on race day as well. A running belt with 7 gels, and my car key. It's probably a bit overkill, but I'm a proponent of the motto \"train how you fight\" and I wanted to get used to carrying that sort of weight around my waist.\n\nNutrition was something I needed to resolve and quickly. I'm used to running after having a decent meal and not needing to refuel much. For a marathon on the other hand, that's not a winning strategy. Eating reheated pasta at 5 AM somehow didn't seem all that much fun. I simulated a race day as close as I could on a long run day by waking up at the necessary time, 5 AM. I ate what I thought I would on the day of, two peanut butter and jelly bagels with 300 mL of black coffee. I'd top that off with one uncaffeinated energy gel 5 mins before the race's start time and get going at 7:30. I usually don't advocate for this, but since it was a race simulation, I ran in zone 3 for all of it. I took a gel every 30-40 minutes and stopped for water every 5km, approximately how far out the race would set up the aid stations. I also would only drink about 60mL per water stop, about how much races tend to pour. Of course, if things were hot enough I'd drink more, but I wanted to see how much I could min-max the water I'd be carrying in my stomach. I felt fine during this practice run, but after finishing the 35km run, my stomach was doing backflips. I was sort of expecting this, since my stomach will act up if I deviate from my normal eating pattern, but this only happens on the first go, and sure enough by next week my body had gotten over it and I could now run comfortably with just energy gels and water.\n\nRecovery was another consideration. Previously, I'd just do a bunch of half-hearted static stretches after each run, but I wanted to see if there was more I could do. I discovered a lovely stretch along channel on YouTube. Run Better with Ash was super helpful with his videos and I definitely felt much more relaxed and recovered after each 10 minute routine. 10 minutes might seem like a lot of time to commit to something like stretching, but it meant I wasn't feeling yesterday's run today. It's anecdotal, but I think that having a better recovery definitely helped lock in any gains made during training and made the whole process more efficient.\n\nUsually I'd use every 4th week as a recovery week in my training blocks. I'd cut mileage down by 15-20% and relax a bit, but in this plan there'd be no breaks until my planned taper period of 3 weeks prior to the race. I've heard a lot that the impressive part of running a marathon is sticking to the training, and I found that to be entirely true. Things felt really regimented and I often found myself digging deep to stick to the training. By the end of week 11, I was pretty beat and ready for the taper. Surprisingly, I found that I wasn't going stir crazy and was just happy to have a break of sorts. The only thing I really missed were my long easy runs. Those are always very therapeutic and I treat them as a kind of active meditation.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe night before, I was raring and ready to go. But, nothing goes exactly as planned. A video shoot at work on the week of the race meant I was on my feet for extended periods in static positions for a day. My right leg usually bears the brunt of this and I'd end up paying for it later on. The weather was also on everyone's mind. It was raining the day and night before the race. To make things worse, the forecast called for rain and a high of 28c and the possibility of a thunderstorm in the afternoon on race day itself. Aside from making things nightmarishly difficult, there was a good to fair chance the race could've been called off. Luckily, things cleared up and we were given a low of 17c and 88% humidity. Not great, but also not terrible. I arrived about half an hour early. I had enough time for a quick bathroom break and warm up. Race day energy was electrifying and I had to rein myself a bit. I definitely wasn't nervous. I trained and prepped as much as I could and now all that was left was to put it to the test. I found myself fighting down the excitement of race day more than anything. The last thing I wanted to do was accidentally do 4 minute kilometres right out the gate. When the time to line up came, I couldn't quite hear the race announcements, and I ended up lining up towards the back, away from my corral. It wasn't a big deal, and I didn't want to make a scene by squirming and shoving my way up there. It'd add maybe a minute or two to the official time.\n\nThe route planned for us would take us from Mississauga's downtown area, out to the suburbs, by the university, and then down to the lake shore. All paved asphalt surfaces and some concrete side walks were the norm. Something to keep an eye out for would be the metal storm grates or manhole covers. I noticed that traction was noticeably worse on these. The race was a net downhill race, but there were numerous hilly areas that we'd be up against. Down and uphill areas often had an aggressive grade and were in quick succession.\n\nI didn't have a specific strategy going in, but my main focus would be to try and stick to at least a 5:27 pace so that I could meet my sub 4 hour objective. This would mean pushing harder in some sections and restraining myself at others. If I fell a bit behind on some sections, I'd try to make up for it on a flat or downhill, but I wouldn't be too pressed about this if I couldn't. Given the weather, just finishing would be a win in my eyes.\n\nMy load out was relatively minimal. A hat, sunglasses, and my usual running shirt and shorts were what I'd wear. In my belt, I had my car key, 6 uncaffeinated energy gels, and 1 caffeinated.  I would rely on the aid stations to provide water. The thought of carrying around a litre of water just didn't seem like a good idea to me. I never got all that thirsty on training runs, and the simulation of the aid station distances were more than sufficient to keep me going. My shoe of choice for this race was the Nike Vaporfly 3s.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race start was super crowded. The half and full marathon runners were all together. I found myself going at about 6 minutes per kilometre. Too slow for my intended objective of sub 4 hours. I needed to be at least 5:27 if I wanted to make it with some time to spare. So, I buckled down and started over-taking anywhere I could to keep pace. Likewise, I tried to make sure I wasn't blocking anyone trying to do the same. It was between either doing a few bursts of speed here, where the course was on relatively wide flat roads, or get stuck behind people on the narrows later on. I heard my watch sound off the first kilometre - 5:19. We were back on track. I kept on overtaking until the first water station came up. This wasn't in the rehearsal, it was at around the 4km mark instead of 5. No worries, it's just a 1km difference. I reached for a cup of water and took it too fast. It was way colder than I thought it'd be and I nearly choked on it. Thankfully the photographer didn't get that, but I made a mental note for that later on. Sip first, then chug.\n\nAfter the 5km mark, we left Mississauga's downtown area and the pack started to stretch out a bit. Then came the first big hurdle. At the 7km mark, there was the Burnhamthrope bridge. The headwinds up there were brutal. They must have been 40km/h gusts and we got hammered. I could only smile, because in training I had encountered 60 km/h gusts that stopped me in my tracks. 40 km/h seemed like a blessing by comparison. After what seemed like an eternity we cleared it. We then got a glimpse of the Half-Marathon pack leaders. All I can say is, wow. What beautiful form. These runners were tearing it up, but even then they still shouted out words of encouragement to us, which we were only too happy to take. And so we soldiered on to the 10km mark and were greeted by the University of Toronto's Mississauga Campus. I don't think many students were still there, but that might've been for the best. I can't imagine that being woken up at 8am by a pack of runners just after exam season would be fun for them. At the bottom of the next hill, the half-marathoners split off from us. Our numbers dramatically thinned.\n\nWith the sun now fully out and baking us in the humidity of last night's rain, we trudged on through the suburbs for the next 10k. The course was super narrow here, we could barely fit in 2 by 2 and at times. We didn't have the entire suburban road to ourselves, so I had to be quicker on my feet and much more creative with my overtakes. I used the sidewalk where I could and the 3 sub 5 minute splits in there are a testament to that. Mercifully, some tree cover overhead gave us all a much needed reprieve. By the time we had reached the halfway mark, exhaustion in our ranks had started to show, but it wasn't much long after this I had caught up to the 4:00:00 pace runner. I did a short celebration after reaching my goal, but there was work to be done. I also wanted to catch 3:50, 3:45, and 3:40 if possible, but with this heat, again, just finishing would be an accomplishment.\n\nTons of locals were out to cheer us on and it didn't go unappreciated. There were folks with Mario Kart inspired signs and although I'm not a Nintendo guy, I definitely stopped for the power ups. A cheer leading squad were also there. Heck, even mayoral candidate was on his lawn to cheer us on (and to campaign of course.) It's difficult to get a feeling of community in a sprawling suburb like Mississauga, but I'd like to think that these folks put on a pretty good showing. A lot of us aren't from the city, but we felt very welcome all the same.\n\nWith our spirits buoyed, the next leg would take us down to the lake shore by the Petro Canada Lubricant factory. This place was loud and not too pleasant smelling. We veered off to the park nearby and each of us caught a face full of bugs before turning back to the suburbs. At around the 29km mark I caught up to the 3:50 pacer. I'd given myself a healthy buffer to work with. Making sub 4 hours was a pretty safe bet now and I relaxed a bit. On the way back up, I noticed our first casualty. A man about my age had a cramp or leg injury and was trying his best to stretch it out. And then the second. I noticed another guy limping along, still at a good pace. We exchanged nods and carried on. I was starting to feel the kilometres as well by this point. Remember that video shoot I had earlier in the week? The camber of the roads had been steadily chipping away at my tired right side. Even with my form being better than it ever was, my right leg was extending just a little more than it was used to and my right quad and calf were starting a protest. My left leg was much better off and I would have to rely on it to give me the power to finish.\n\nAt the 30km aid station, I had a decision to make. Up until this point I drank exclusively water, out of fear of a sugar crash. I've largely cut sugar out of my diet and the only time I'd be taking it on directly would be in energy gels or sports drinks. Both of which I have in moderation. I'm also one to abide by the old adage of \"nothing new on race day,\" but given what I just saw, I reasoned that I must be sweating considerably more than training. My heart rate was about 7 bpm higher than usual as well, so electrolytes it was for the rest of the race.\n\nThe next 5k was a blur. All I remember is feeling how brutal the hilly terrain was. The Mississauga Marathon is a net downhill race, but it sure as heck didn't feel like it on the day. This section had a bunch of elevation changes back to back. My core was put to work on the downhills and my legs on the uphills. What snapped me back to reality was a group of locals. A mom brought her three boys out to see the race. They were having a blast and high-fiving all the runners they could. Not wanting to disappoint, I thanked them for coming out and high fived them as well. A few motorists also joined in and gave us a few motivational honks and cheers.\n\nAfter that quick morale boost, I got to the 35km marker. This was it, uncharted territory. This was further than I had ever ran and what I trained for. I did a quick self-assessment. I definitely still had plenty of fuel left in the tank. I decided to hold steady for now until the last 4km and then would reassess if I wanted to do a final spurt. My pace had crept up closer to 5:00 / km. I couldn't tell if it was the sugar high from all of the energy gels I was eating or if it was a runner's high, but I leaned into it and passed the 3:45:00 pacer.\n\nFor the final leg, we'd be heading back down to the lake. The parks weren't closed off to the public, nor was the route too clearly marked, so this leg was part-obstacle course. After weaving in and out of Sunday strollers, on tired legs, I saw the 38km mark and decided it was time to turn it on. I aimed for a pace of 4:30 and started overtaking as many folks as I could. This was the final push to improve my overall position. I could see the big purple finish line. I rounded the final corner and saw there wasn't anyone in front of me. The thought crossed my mind \"huh, it's almost like a first place finish.\" I stormed across the finish line and one of the volunteers joyfully put the medal on me.\n\n# Post-race\n\nA mix of elation and relief took over, quickly followed by the feeling of two aching legs. I even forgot to hit the stop button on my watch. I quickly exchanged some congratulations with another runner that finished ahead of me. This gentleman was older than I am and no doubt far more experienced, if nothing else I can only hope to follow in his footsteps. Niceties aside, none of us really wanted to stick around for too long. The rain was coming. We hopped on the shuttle buses and those of us who finished in that block just barely missed being rained on. I couldn't believe my luck. The weather had held off just enough for me to do what I needed to do. The bus eventually came to its stop and the sound of the door was quickly followed by the collective \"OW!\" of 2 dozen runners. Sitting for half an hour on a bus did us no favours and we all limped off, thanking the driver. By now the rain was pouring. The walk back to the car was essentially a cold shower, but I really didn't mind it. It was even a bit refreshing, but I think for next time I'll go through bag check and keep a poncho handy. I collapsed into my car and put a jacket on to warm up before letting friends and family know what I had just done. After a quick ready check on my driving foot, all systems were green and I drove back home.\n\nI finished 173rd out of 667 runners. As far as first attempts go, this was a pretty solid one and I have no regrets signing up for it. What I love about this whole experience was how focused my training felt. Usually I find that the hardest part of running is to get up and started, but with the marathon in mind, I found I was actively looking forward to my training runs. I'll definitely be looking to sign up for another one next year. I just hope there'll be cooler weather next time.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

I feel accomplished, happy and very emotional right now.\n\nI have a long history of struggling with weight and self-confidence. I went from 80kg (176lb) at the end of high school, to 120kg (265lb) a couple years into university, while also starting to smoke. After that I lost around 30kg (66lb) by changing my diet and then stayed around that weight for years. \n\nThroughout all this time I struggled with my weight and my looks and at some point in 2017 or 2018 I did the C25k program, finished it and pretty much lost all motivation to keep going, and just stopped doing any exercise again. Then in 2019 in one of the now very familiar struggles I got the urge to get active again, and joined the gym with the intention to try the C25k program again. This time I finished it and actually stuck to running, eventually leaving the gym, quitting cigarettes, and switched to running outside.\n\nI ran for almost 10 months, everything was going well, eventually going up to 10k and 21k in training. I ran 10k in the last version of the Rock N Roll Santiago in 2020, and I was registered to run a 21k in the 2020 Maratón de Santiago (MDS). And then the pandemic hit. I remember starting lockdown literally the day after I ran the RnR Santiago, lol. Well, 2020 MDS got canceled, and because of the pandemic I pretty much stopped running again.\n\nI tried to pick it up again when they let us go outside, but I struggled with knee pain every time, which left me very unmotivated. I kept gaining weight, eventually going up to around 98kg (216lb). \n\nAnd then a year ago (almost to the day) I decided to lose weight again and get fit, but do it right this time. I would follow the C25k program religiously and not get too ahead of myself. To my surprise everything went pretty much perfect, and I finished the program for the 3rd time in my life. Now at this point I had already decided to run the half-marathon at MDS 2024, but to manage this I would need to run more, a lot more. And lose weight.\n\nWhen I get obsessed with something I usually investigate a lot, and found some half-marathon plans online and in books, and created my own base building plan based on everything I had read. Sadly, I neglected what I would find out was one of the most important things - strength training. Around November I started experiencing knee pain again, so at some point I decided to stop again and never run again. ([Hmm, I wonder why the pain started around November](https://i.imgur.com/TRhp4qp.png))\n\nI was pretty sad and the next day all I could think was why so many people could run without pain and I couldn't, and decided to consult a doctor specialized in sports, specifically running and knees. After explaining everything, he made me lie down, touched my knee at a specific place and said \"this hurts, right?\". To my surprise, hell yes that hurt. He knew immediately what it was. IT Band Syndrome, he said. I thought he would say I was done and would need surgery or something extreme which would pretty much make me stop running forever. Of course I was being a little bitch, and he told me to stop running for now, derived me to a PT, and said to not run until the PT told me otherwise.\n\nWell, the first thing the PT told me was to not stop running but to split my runs and increase the number of days from 3 to 6 per week, all while making me do a bunch of strength training exercises at their gym, between 2 to 3 times a week. About a month later there was no knee pain anymore. I was so happy when I realized my knee hadn't hurt for a while. I started testing the limit and luckily I could maintain a way higher volume now that my legs were a bit stronger.\n\nWhen comparing my progress to the first time I took running seriously (right before the pandemic), I noticed this time it went a little bit slower, but it was very similar.\n\nI kept losing weight and increasing my volume until it was finally time to start my training block.\n\n### Training\nThe training block was an adapted Pete Pfitzinger half-marathon training plan. The key things I changed was I wanted to run 6 days a week, since I was used to this by now, so I split the easy days but kept everything else. Hill workouts I also modified because there's literally no hills nearby that I could walk or run to, and I knew if I had to drive I would eventually just not walk out of the house and skip them. In hindsight, I would've really benefited from hill workouts and will definitely do them in future blocks.\n\nI also had to change a few of the saturday runs, making them shorter or sometimes cutting them altogether so I could go hike with friends. I didn't think it would be a problem since I would be hiking and on my feet for 4+ hrs.\n\nOf course, I kept doing the exercises I had learned during my PT sessions and adding some other strength training routines I found on YouTube.\n\nDuring training I used the ON Cloudmonsters for pretty much every run until around a month before goal race. I loved this shoe but I was afraid it would run out of juice before the race, and couldn't find my size anywhere in my country to replace them, so I did a lot of the remaining runs on the Brooks Adrenaline 22. On the 10k race in week 10 I used the Cloudmonsters and for some reason they were scratching against my heel and actually made me bleed. So I just assumed they were done (put over 700km on them), and the last week of the block gave a second chance to the ASICS Gel Nimbus 25, which I had tried before but got me blisters. This time the ASICS worked fine and decided I'd run the race in them.\n\nMy original goal for the race was 2:00:00 (6min/km pace), but apparently that was very conservative. 3 weeks before goal race I ran a half-marathon in my hometown and performed surprisingly well (1:58:58), so thanks to my friend who convinced me to run this as I was originally not going to. I was extremely happy with this result, but also very nervous, as I was scared I wouldn't be able to perform better than this on the actual goal race, making the training block a bit underwhelming. I had to reevaluate and update my goal, and decided from how I felt in this race that in a perfect day I could probably run at 5:25 pace (for a finish time of 1:54:15).\n\nNext week I ran a 10k race, where I again surprised myself, hitting 49:14, my first sub-50min 10k! I didn't know what to expect, but I ran to effort and it went very well.\n\nI would say overall the training block went as expected and worked great. I had a particularly hard week because of a big life changing event that happened to me, which had me extremely stressed and sleeping very little, but luckily I kept my resolve and did not skip any runs, even though they were absolutely awful.\n\nThis was my running volume during the block:\n\n| Week| Distance |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 62km (38.5mi)\n| 2 | 65km (40.4mi)\n| 3 | 64km (39.7mi)\n| 4 | 64km (39.7mi)\n| 5 | 70km (43.4mi)\n| 6 | 77km (47.8mi)\n| 7 | 73km (45.3mi)\n| 8 | 81km (50mi)\n| 9 | 73km (45.3mi, including 21k \"training\" race)\n| 10 | 85km (52.8mi, including 10k race)\n| 11 | 54km (33.5mi, + metal fest, 8+ hrs standing up for 2 days)\n| 12 | 62km (38.5mi, including goal race)\n\n### Pre-race\nI didn't know where to add this, I guess here is fine - I showed up to the race at the lowest weight of my adult life at 83kg (183lb), losing around 15kg in the last 6 months.\n\nThe night before I got everything ready for next morning. Checked the weather and realized it was looking to be pretty much perfect! I don't have problems with sleep the night before, and this whole week I got around 8hrs a night average (I tried for more but would just wake up naturally).\n\nI had tried everything out in the race 3 weeks earlier, so I knew some small changes I needed to do. I brought 2 gels (21g of carbs each) and a 350ml flexible bottle with 40g of carbs mixed in (just maltodextrin and fructose). I carb loaded for around 3 days before, and had a PB&J sandwich for breakfast. Also on the way to the race I drank a 1L gatorade and ate around 50g of solid carbs. Honestly I'm not sure if these amounts are good but they had worked for me in training so I just went with it.\n\nI walked around 25 mins to the closest open metro station and got in for a 15 min ride to the start line. This was pretty cool, the metro was open earlier than usual just for the event, so it was packed with runners.\n\nI arrived around an hour before my start time, so got to see the marathon runners start. I haven't participated in a lot of races yet but this was the best execution and organization I've seen so far, not even close. It was over 30,000 people running (13,000 for the 10k, 12,000 for the half and 5,000 for the full) and it felt smoother than all my other races.\n\nUsed the toilet like 4 times and got a quick warm up done, then got in the corral.\n\n### Race\nThe race was \"downhill\" (small elevation loss) for the first 3km, flat for the next 2, uphill for the next 11, and then you lose all that elevation in the last 5km. I didn't have a super specific race plan, but I wanted to run fast on the downhill at the start, slow on the uphill and then use all the energy I had left on the last 5km downhill.\n\nDuring the race at different points I started getting very emotional, just thinking about all the time I'd invested into running, and everything that has happened during this last year, but thankfully managed to keep it all inside.\n\nKM 0-5 - I ran by feel on the downhill, which was a mistake. By the time I thought of looking at my watch I noticed my HR was extremely high for this early in the race (around 185, my max is 196 according to my watch), so I let go of the woman that had been running with me for the last 3km and slowed down to get my HR a bit lower before the uphill. I started sipping on my carb drink.\n\nKM 6-10 - I kept running mostly by feel, but kept looking at my watch, and I was not happy when I just couldn't get my HR below 180, and kept worrying I would not be able to finish the uphill. The only thing that kept me going and going was thinking about the 5km downhill at the end of the race. Up until this point there was a very small amount of spectators, but the few were really appreciated. I kept sipping on my carb drink until it ran out. I drank gatorade in 2 stations.\n\nKM 11-15 - Oh man, the uphill got a bit more steep, and my HR was not showing any improvements, obviously, but I kept forcing myself to think about that precious 5km downhill at the end. Crowds at this point started to pick up, there were points with A LOT of people, so I didn't skip a single high five and power up, anything to keep me from thinking about what I was doing to my body. I ate a gel at some point and drank water at the stations.\n\nKM 16-21 - Holy shit the uphill was finally over. I thought it would never end. Even more crowds now, and all that was left was the downhill. Time to speed up! I was feeling good, reinvigorated by all of that, but failed to realize my body was pretty beat up after those 11 kilometers of hell. I was really, really struggling now, but somehow I kept going. My legs hurt, my ass hurt, my lower back hurt, breathing hurt. I honestly thought my legs could stop working at any point, since for the last 3km I had been trying very hard to push but my body would just not go any faster, and so many people were passing me.\n\nOfficial chip time 1:53:50. \n\n3556 out of 11437 runners.\n\n633 out of 1449 runners in my category. I'm in the top 50%, yay!\n\n### Post-race\nI was so happy it was over, but honestly it felt a bit underwhelming? I thought all the emotions would come up at the end, but instead they just came during the race. I don't know, maybe it was because I was struggling so much at the end, I didn't feel strong, even though I had just met all the goals I'd set.\n\nI went to get my medal, eat my banana, drink my gatorade, grab my bag, and take a selfie. Then hopped on the crowded metro and went home, not really feeling much.\n\n4 days later and writing all of this down, I can say I'm really happy with how everything turned out. I mean, when I started the training block my goal was running at 6:00 pace, and I ran at 5:21! That is a crazy jump and it honestly really motivates me to keep going. I don't know what the next challenge will be, but in the meantime I'll just keep base building.\n\nI'm really surprised at my HR, it felt like this was exactly the highest I could sustain the 21k for, but I was actually scared about it being so high. [Garmin stats if anyone is interested](https://i.imgur.com/hyAVFrp.png).\n\n### What's next?\nAs I said, not really sure what race I'll sign up for, but I would like to get faster before I attempt another half-marathon block, and after that, maybe try the marathon, but even writing about trying the marathon makes me nervous, lol.\n\nI learned a lot, but the biggest takeaways were:\n\n- Strength training is the single most important thing for my body to stay injury free.\n\n- Sleeping well really does make running so much easier.\n\n- During the race, drinking carbs works much better for me than gels. And for before the race, eating solid carbs (candy mostly) also works much better for me than gels. I've realized I don't really like gels, even though they don't really upset my stomach or anything, not sure what it is about them that make me not want to eat them.\n\n- I need to do a much better assessment of current fitness before starting a training block. I think I was in a much better shape than I thought, and my goals were too conservative.\n\n- This was the first event I didn't have any friends or family spectating (the people I told just couldn't make it, life happens) and I ran it alone, so it felt a bit lonely. I will definitely try to run the next one with a friend as I did on my previous half, it feels so much easier.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading and hope you crush your goals on your next race!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

Entering my 30s with a toddler, I wanted to prove I wasn’t over the hill and foolishly asked for an entry for Christmas. (I should have gone with chocolates.) I chose Boston - Lincolnshire in the UK, not Massachusetts - and committed to 'training properly' and getting my mojo back. From January to mid-March, it went swimmingly. I was running more than I had since my son was born, and the long runs up to 18 miles were feeling easy. Then, six weeks before race day, he entered a phase of terrible sleeping which left us exhausted and me in no mood to start running when he went to bed at 10pm. I downgraded my expectations and prayed that conditions were good on the day.\r  \n\r  \n\\### Pre-race\r  \nConditions were not good. They could be described as abysmal, with pelting rain and wind. I joined the other runners in huddling under shop windows for shelter in Boston marketplace. With the weather showing no sign of stopping, I opted for a long sleeved top plus a slightly waterproof one with a hood which I could ditch if things improved (they didn't). There were only 700 or so doing the marathon - a far cry from tens of thousands at my previous marathons in Manchester. Like condemned prisoners, we shuffled to the start line at 7am.\r  \n\r  \n\\### Race\r  \nBoston prides itself as the flattest marathon in the UK, with most of it along pothole-ridden country lanes through the nearby villages. However, the flat farmland gives no protection at all from the elements. Locals came out to cheer us as we got battered sideways by the wind and rain. Despite this, I was happy with the pace at each of the first 13 miles (between 8:30 and 9 minutes) and began entertaining dreams of a sub 4 hour run.\r  \nBut the wheels fell off quite quickly in the second half. My legs felt like lead and I took the first walk around 15 miles. Suddenly I felt awful, and was struggling to keep my eyes open with the pelting rain and fatigue. As I dragged myself through the next water station, it hit me - how much had I actually drunk? With the water raining down, I only been taking sips and was probably pretty dehydrated. I took on a full bottle and began to feel better. The next few miles were more walk than run, but unfortunately my weak spell had come during a particularly heavy downpour and I now impossibly cold. I was shivering and worn out, physically and mentally. At the next water station, I found a marshall and told him: “I need to drop. I can’t get back to the start.” He looked baffled and said: “Well I don’t know how you do that. Best keep walking to the next point and ask them.”\r  \nThe next four miles are a bit of a mystery. Somehow I walk-shuffled to mile 24, looking like an old man with a bad back and purposefully ignoring my Garmin. Swearing got me through the next mile, which was almost entirely running into the wind. At 24, I saw my time wasn’t as bad as I feared and pledged to not stop running again, no matter how slowly I was going. I managed a mini-rally coming back into Boston, and dragged myself across the finish line looking like a drowned rat, but with a time I was very happy with.\r  \n\r  \n\\### Post-race\r  \nChanging out of my wet clothes was agonising but such a relief. I made the necessary detour to McDonalds for a huge burger and put on my marathon playlist for the drive home. I told everyone I would never do another marathon. But… maybe just one?\r  \n\r  \nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

        "Texto": "I've always gotten a kick out of writing race reports, but for some reason, I've never done one for a 100 miler. It's not like there's not plenty to write about. Maybe it's because I like to write race reports pretty soon after the race, and I can't muster up the mental energy soon enough after a 100.\n\nBut this time, I'm going to do it!\n\n##The Race\n\nC&O Canal 100 Miler  \nDate: April 27, 2024  \nDistance: 100 miles  \n\n##Goals\n\nMy last 100 miler, Dark Anchor in Savannah, GA in January, did not go as planned. I had wanted to run it in under 20 hours, but instead it took me over 26 hours. I have a whole host of excuses why:\n\n1. The terrain was not quite what I expected - flat, yes, but the road portion was lumpy and heavily cambered and the trail portion was sandy and rooty. Not really conducive to the kind of pace I was going for. I was expecting more of a crushed gravel path.\n2. I wore road shoes for the first 28 miles like a doofus.\n3. There was a group of 10 of us that went to Savannah, and we partied pretty hard two nights before. Probably not a great idea.\n\nSo I redirected my attention to C&O, which is a local race, and it's run on a crushed gravel path that I'm familiar with. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was opened in 1830, just in time for railroads to make canals mostly obsolete. I think that's right. Don't ask me for a history lesson here. Anyway, the canal is no longer there (well, it's *there*; it's just not filled with navigable water), but the towpath is, and is maintained by the National Park Service. It's a lovely 185 mile flat trail that goes from Cumberland, MD to Washington, DC. I know a lot of people who hate running on it. I love it. Give me a flat and easy-to-follow trail, and I will run on it all goddamn day.\n\nAnyway, this is the Goals section. My goal was to go sub 20. That's a 12 minute pace.\n\n##The Spreadsheet\n\nIn order to meet this goal, I built myself a spreadsheet a couple weeks before the race. It splits the race into 3 sections, and allows you to set run/walk intervals (time or distance) and paces for each section. I had it set up [thusly](https://i.imgur.com/YdGi1Dq.png). So, the way this reads is that I would run a 9:15 pace for the first 31 miles (50k), a 10:00 minute pace for the next 31 miles, then a 2/1 run walk interval with a 12:00 minute running pace and 16:00 walking pace. The \"Calculated Pace\" takes the intervals into account. The \"Effective Pace\" takes into account how long you plan to stop at each aid station, which you fill in elsewhere.\n\nThe spreadsheet predicts your arrival at each aid station based on these paces. A crew member can also fill in your *actual* arrival times at the aid stations, and it will adjust the predicted times going forward.\n\nI'm not ready to share this spreadsheet yet, but thank you for your interest 😉 There is still one more feature I'd like to add, which I am going to call the Manidokan Factor, for reasons which will become clear...\n\nAt any rate, these pace selections had me finishing in 19:54:12. Perfect!\n\nThis also meant I would need to run a PR 50 miler, and a PR 100k (each by an hour or more) on the way to finishing this 100 miler.\n\nRelevant PRs:  \n50k: 4:47  \n50 mile: 9:25  \n100k: 11:45  \n100 mile: 22:05\n\n##The Race\nThe weather was looking great when I looked at the forecast a week before the race. But, starting a few days before the race, the forecast started to include rain and cooler temperatures. Cool temperatures are nice for a faster race, but they can really mess with you during long races, especially at night. Anyway, the start of the race was in the high 40s, and then once it got into the 50s, it just stayed in the 50s all day and all night. Also, there were showers off and on from about 10:30 AM to 1:00 PM. Not ideal, in terms of the precipitation, but the consistent temperature was nice. That meant minimal worry about needing additional layers and such.\n\nOn that note, I decided to bring almost everything I would need with me, so there would be no mucking about with drop bags. I had my headlamp, an extra layer (in a plastic bag to keep it dry), and a buff to wear on my head at night, all stuffed into the back pocket of my hydration vest, which has bottles on the front. I started the race with a cap, but the buff is slightly warmer for nighttime, and also doesn't block half the light coming off my headlamp.\n\nMy friends J, F, N, A, L, and V, who very conveniently have different first initials, were also running.\n\nOkay, on to mile 1.\n\nWhile 95% of this course is on the crushed gravel of the towpath, the start/finish is at the top of a hill **260 feet** above. The race starts in a grassy field to spread the runners out, followed by a descent of all 260 feet in about a half mile. That hill would need to be descended 2 more times during the race, and you guessed it, ascended 3 times. It's the hill to Camp Manidokan, where the race starts, and the namesake of my new spreadsheet feature.\n\nI finished the first mile in 12:00 flat. Exactly on goal pace, but not exactly on spreadsheet pace. But obviously mile 1 was supposed to be an outlier. No matter. Once I was on the towpath, it was smooth sailing.\n\nThe first section of the race takes us north and west (upstream along the Potomac), past a couple aid stations which were not open yet. 10 miles out, turn around at the cone, make sure they record your bib number, and 10 miles back. Easy enough. I was a little ahead of pace here, but not too far. I had run with J and L for a couple miles, but they were going just a tad faster than I wanted to, so I backed off. A was way ahead. F, N, and V were behind. Since the course is pretty much all out and backs, we had plenty of chances to say hi and to give each other high fives.\n\nI caught up to J and L around mile 20, because they were starting a run/walk interval plan after the initial 20 mile shakeout. On their second or third walk interval, I passed them, reminding them to walk like the Terminator (at what I like to call \"Have you seen this boy?\" pace).\n\nAt a 50 miler a few weeks ago, my last training run for this race, I discovered (or [rediscovered?](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/cva7u1/the_baker_trail_ultrachallenge_or_what_happens/)) how good Doritos are as a race fuel. I don't know what it is, but just a few of them can give me a noticeable kick in the same way a salt capsule can. Maybe it's the MSG, because plain Tostitos don't have the same effect. Anyway, I told my friends about this phenomenon before the race, and several of them were volunteering at the aid stations, so they made sure they were stocked with Doritos. I'd pursue a sponsorship, but I'm not *that* fast. All I'd probably get would be free bags of Doritos, and as much as I love them, I'm a good runner because I don't eat foods in that category unless I'm actually running 😂\n\nAnyway, for a significant portion of this race, I was carrying a bag of Doritos. If not for the rain, I probably would have finished the race with an orange index finger and thumb on my right hand.\n\nAt the south/east turnaround at Brunswick, I had counted the people coming in the opposite direction, and it looked like I was in the top 10 or so? I thought that was nice. And A was in first! Behind me, J and L were still running together, then F, N, and V.\n\nSomewhere in here, I finished the first 50k, and came within 10 minutes of my PR: 4:57\n\nClimbing the 260 feet back up to Manidokan at mile 40 sucked. Nothing more needs to be said.\n\nFor the second trip out to the path, it was still raining, but I was still locked onto my predicted pace. In fact, I was 20 or so minutes ahead, because I was supposed to slow down at mile 31, and I didn't. Suck it, wall!\n\nOn the way up to the north turaround at Antietam, I passed a guy who very helpfully informed me that second place was just a couple minutes ahead. Oh cool, tha-\n\nWait, what? I just passed the third place guy? I'm in third place? Naa, can't be. He's mistaken. So I asked at Antietam if the guy I had just seen leaving the aid station was in second place.\n\n\"Yep!\"  \n\"So I'm in third place?\"  \n\"Yep!\"  \n\"That doesn't make any sense.\"  \n\"Well, you're killin' it!\"\n\nI had averaged a 9:55 pace through mile 44. My predicted average pace to that point was 10:23, so I was a little faster than my goal. I just didn't think... well, nothing to it but to get back out there and catch up to second place guy. So I did, and I passed him.\n\nSomewhere in here, I set a new 50 mile PR: 8:20\n\nOn the way south again, I saw L. \"How are you not dying?\" she asked. \"Doritos,\" I answered. She also had a goal to run sub 20, and I could see in her face that she did not expect to make that goal. She was the third place female at that moment, though. I think I missed J and F going south, because they were on the Manidokan Hill, but I saw V.\n\nComing to the south end of the loop again, I saw A coming the other way, in first place with a commanding lead ahead of... me. He gave me a high five, but I wasn't thinking clearly, and had my Dorito bag in my left hand, so he crushed my Doritos, and along with them, my hopes and dreams. Just kidding, my hopes and dreams didn't die until later.\n\nThe aid station at Keep Tryst had ginger rice soup, which was the most amazing aid station food ever, and that's saying something, because the aid station at Dargan Bend had peanut butter fudge that was simply mind-blowing. Okay, I admit, I made the peanut butter fudge, but still, that shit is like crack. But the ginger rice soup saved my bacon during this race. Even more so than the bacon did.\n\nSomewhere in here, I set a new 100k PR: 10:26\n\nM, one of the volunteers at Keep Tryst, ran with me for a while when I left going northbound. We hadn't seen each other since August, and we needed to catch up, inasmuch as she had forgotten my name since the last time we had talked. I tried to scare her off with a really loud fart (my motto - \"Always trust a fart. Always. Especially at mile 63.\"), but it backfired (badum-tsss!) and made her laugh, and now I think she knows my name.\n\nClimbing the 260 feet back up to Manidokan at mile 70 sucked. Nothing more needs to be said.\n\nI picked up my first pacer, R, and she came in at just the right time. I had just fallen back into third, and she kept me distracted with stories and jokes and commiseration. A few miles in, she said, \"So we're just gonna run this whole thing? No walk breaks?\" And I realized that I was over 10 miles into the section of my spreadsheet where I had predicted I would be doing run/walk intervals of 2/1 minutes and paces of 12:00 and 16:00. Instead I was running 10s, and only walking to eat.\n\nBut it didn't last. I saw second place coming back the other way, and I knew I wouldn't be able to catch up to him. My hopes and dreams of second place (A was too far ahead of me to even consider catching up to him) died at mile 75, and I finally hit the wall as I got out my headlamp and turned it on. I still was sticking to my predicted pace though. And I knew I'd make sub 20. The only thing left was to actually, you know, do it. And that is a tough moment in long races like this, for me, anyway. It's when you know you're going to finish, and you know you're going to hit your goals, and the only thing left is to run all the miles that are left.\n\nAt the Dargan Bend aid station, all my friends who were there, including L, who had dropped out, helped me with putting on an extra layer and getting my bottles filled. I turned down a piece of my own peanut butter fudge because I didn't have the saliva to eat anything that wasn't wet. I hadn't had a Dorito in over 20 miles. I exchanged R for G to pace me, and we made our way down to Keep Tryst and the Brunswick turnaround for the last time. I had more ginger rice at Keep Tryst - even though I was nauseous and hated all foods, I wolfed down a bowl in about 30 seconds. G told me more jokes, and kept me going to the exchange with K, my pacer for the last 10 miles. At Brunswick, I ate a piece of bacon, dribbled out some watermelon, farted, and then K and I headed back north for the home stretch. He played me his Hall & Oates playlist, and told me more jokes, and I whined. A couple more people passed me.\n\nClimbing the 260 feet back up to Manidokan at mile 100 sucked. Nothing more needs to be said.\n\nOfficial results haven't been posted yet, and the live tracking is jacked, but it looks like I finished in 5th place, which matches what I was thinking. My official time should be about 19:23:30 when it all settles out. Of my friends, A, J, and I were the only ones that finished. It was J's first 100, so congratulations to her, and A finished in first, so congratulations to him! L, F, N, and V dropped out because they're punk ass quitters. Also because sometimes, it's a good idea to quit a race that is not going well so you can live to fight another day. You've got to listen to your body and keep yourself healthy. Also they're punk ass quitters.\n\n[Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/11280270385)\n\n##Post Race\n\nSomewhere in there, I set a new 100 mile PR.\n\nEverything hurts, and I'm dying."

I've worked up from the 5k distance, to getting comfortable doing 10ks, which inevitably led to my first half marathon, last may. Every race though, and every training block, there was always the thought of the marathon in the back of my head, that every race and practice was to get good at X distance, so that I can eventually qualify for Boston. Years ago in my dorm-room in college I remember learning about the significance of Boston, of qualifying, what the standard was, and what pace was needed. I thought at the time I could just run that pace everyday until I could eventually reach the marathon distance, very wrong. I gave up running a month or so after that, didn't run for 4 years roughly. Flash-forward to this morning, race day.... I'm an absolute bundle of nerves, I'm aware of how big of an undertaking I'm trying to do, with all the pressure of trying to do this on my first attempt. My goal was to hit around 2:51:XX, which meant around a 6:32 pace. This is what I'd practiced for months. I knew the day was going to be hot and humid and I could already feel it by the time I got to the race.   \nRace\n\nThe plan was to settle at 6:40-6:45 for the first few miles and settle my way down once I got comfortable. As the splits show, this comfort happened a little too fast. I felt good going out, with TONS of runners around me. I was having some difficulty finding my pace at times, feeling myself ebb and flow between the different groups, feeling people split off, come up, drop back. Eventually by 5 miles in a pack had formed, with me at the back, trying to keep a low 6:40, trying to gauge my body and go off my Garmin but every-time  creeping up a little fast. I'd decided to hang with a few different runners, exchanging pleasantries, asking about the marathon experience. By this point I was feeling good, I wasn't going at a slow pace I knew that, and I kept waiting for the hammer to drop at any second, probably a big mentality mistake. Pretty abruptly around 7 or 8 miles in I remember looking behind me and seeing no-one, not on any straightaways, not coming around any corners, not straggling a quarter of a mile away. I was internally pretty jarred by this, knowing that I'd have to stick with this pace group if I wanted to have people around me, especially so early into the race. I kept it nice and comfy until around 10 miles, when I mentally decided to drop the whole 6:40 schtick and drop it down to 6:30s consciously this time. I crept up the race a bit and latched onto this guy I'd met earlier, who was consistently hitting 6:35s. I decided to stick with him. After mile 10 the next three miles flew by, half marathon came and went, was still feeling good by this point. Some looong straightaways (I think) was maybe the highlight of the race? It felt like 3 straight miles of just flat flat flat, felt amazing. Fast forward to Mr. Struggle time. I was aware it was going to get tough at 18 miles, and it did, not that bad, but I was more aware of the effort I was putting in at this point. I should've been happier when 20 miles hit but at this point in the race it had started flooding, the rain by this point was somewhat torrential and very windy. I dropped an earbud, my bib started ripping, my shoes were water-logged (not that others weren't). This is when it started to SUCK. I don't know exactly when I had this thought but something I need to work on is mentality, because around the 20 mile marker I started thinking to myself how it wouldn't be that bad now if I'd stopped, that 20 miles was enough, that if I just cantered the next 6.2 I'd be happy with that, that I can try sub 3 another time. There was never a snap back to reality moment, but I kept pushing, maybe I could've pushed more? but I was pushing nonetheless. Also to note, I've been having terrible stomach problems for the past 6 months that causes bloating whenever I take in certain foods, I discovered last week...one of these is sugar. What was I taking in every half hour? SUGAR. My stomach didn't feel that bad, until 20 miles. I kept having to burp and if you've ever run with carbonation in your system it feels like air is stuck at the bottom of your throat and won't come out. At this point I started gagging accidentally, not helpful and not fun. It was also at this point I think I made the biggest mistake, I'd done the math of how fast I'd have to run to still go sub 3, and what I thought was sub 2:55, and realized I could (actually not) stick to that pace and try to finish the race that way. Maybe I shouldn't have done this maybe it didn't matter, because finishing at that pace still felt absurdly difficult, I had nothing at all left in my tank, which is very different than how I normally finish races. Race eventually finished, tiredness ensuing.   \nThoughts  \nMixed feelings. I wanted 2:51, I wanted to get so far under the 3 hours that going to Boston was way more likely. I also wanted to finish stronger than I finished, but I made a mistake somewhere in the race and wasn't able to find it mentally to push even further. I'm still incredibly happy, happy to be done, happy to stop having to go to bed at 9 pm to prep for a 5 am wakeup time, happy to be done with this training block and happy to finish sub 3 in my first marathon. There's more I wanted from today but it didn't work out that way.   \nMade with a new race report generator created by /u/herumph."

It lets the mods group posts into Collections.  We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users.  We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed.  Here's the link to the wiki with a list of the current Collections.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/collections/\n\nPlease note, Collections only works for New Reddit and the Reddit mobile app for iOS.\n\n\n\n__________\n\n###**Using r/running**\n\n\n\nThe mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*\n\nThe mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.\n\nRegardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.\n\nWe are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.\n\n_____\n\n\n###**Recurring Threads**\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).\n\nHere are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  \n\n*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by \"Hot\" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by \"New\" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*\n\n* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!\n\n* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.\n\n* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cvfhs1/the_weekly_training_thread/)\n\n* [Miscellaneous Monday General Chit-Chat (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cwejfu/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat/)\n\n* [Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cw6n37/lil_race_report_thread/)\n\n* [Super Moronic Monday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cx5c46/super_moronic_monday_your_weekly_tuesday_stupid/)\n\n* [Run Nutrition Tuesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cwyzqn/run_nutrition_tuesday/)\n\n* [Tuesday Shoesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cwyzq9/tuesday_shoesday/)\n\n* [Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cxray2/lurkers_wednesday/)\n\n* [What Are You Wearing Wednesday Weekly Gear Thread (Wednesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cxray5/what_are_you_wearing_wednesday_weekly_gear_thread/)\n\n* [Weekly Complaints & Confessions Thread (Thursdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1ctbn34/weekly_complaints_confessions_thread/)\n\n* [Photo Friday (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cu4ch8/its_photo_friday_lets_see_your_running_pictures/)\n\n* [The Weekend Thread (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cu4ph6/the_weekend_thread_17th_may_2024/)\n\n* [Race Roll Call (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1ctw8ie/race_roll_call/)\n\n* [Social Saturday (Saturdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cuon2o/social_saturday/)\n\n* [Monthly Updates & Check In Thread (First Day of the Month)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1b3n3ln/february_monthly_updates_check_in_thread/)\n_____\n\n###**Rules**\nWe have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.\n\n **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  \n\nThis sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.\n\nIf you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Current MPW + pace\n\n* Previous peak MPW\n\n* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed\n\n* Goals (including specific races)\n\n* Previous PRs\n\n* Other things you think might be helpful to include\n\nBelow are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:\n\n* \"Does anyone else...\" type posts?\n\n* \"Is X a good time for...?\" posts\n\n* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).\n\n* If your question can be asked in one sentence.\n\n* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.\n\n* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.\n\n* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  \n\n* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.\n\nFinally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.\n\n **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  \n\nWhile there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  \n\nThere is a big difference between \"Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?\" and \"My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?\" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.\n\nAlso, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.\n\n_____________________\n\n\nFinally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.\n\n###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**"

        "Texto": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Blue Ridge Half Marathon\n* **Date:** April 20, 2024\n* **Distance:** 13.1 miles\n* **Location:** Roanoke, VA\n* **Website:** https://blueridgemarathon.com\n* **Time:** 1:47:43\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Finish | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 2:10 | *Yes* |\n| C | Sub 2 | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 8:36\n| 2 | 8:43\n| 3 | 9:29\n| 4 | 8:23\n| 5 | 6:26\n| 6 | 6:50\n| 7 | 8:03\n| 8 | 8:09\n| 9 | 9:49\n| 10 | 8:43\n| 11 | 7:54\n| 12 | 6:59\n| 13 | 8:01\n\n### Background/Training\n\nThis is known as “America’s Toughest Road Race” and I admit it lived up to the hype!  I’ve been eyeing this race for a number of years but never pulled the trigger.  I’ve done one full marathon and four other half marathons where they were all mostly flat.  Canyonlands Half in Moab being the exception to the rule two years ago where the race was all downhill with elevation ascent 412 feet / descent 491 feet.  I live in Virginia Beach where there is zero elevation so I had to learn on the fly with controlling my breathing during that race since I was not used to having to go up and down so much.  For this race with a total elevation gain of 1,897 feet and equal loss of 1,897 feet, I knew I needed some kind of hill training if I was going to survive.  \n\nFor reference, I am 5’7”, 157 pounds, and I’ve been running pretty regularly for the past 15 years although I wouldn’t categorize myself as your typical runner where you would run 4-5 days or more per week.  I’ve had knee injuries in the distant past (ACL reconstructive and medial meniscus repair in my right knee and no ACL in my left knee) so I limit my running to 2-3 days a week and never on consecutive days.  I remember when I started to inquire about training plans for my first half marathon back in 2011 that I read this one article that suggested “less is more”.  It was a fascinating read and I adopted that mantra to create a training plan where I would run on Tuesdays (short run; 3-5 miles) and Thursdays (slightly longer run; 6-7 miles) with my long run on Saturdays (gradual build-up of a mile more a week to 12).  Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays were reserved for strength training workouts (used the beachbody workouts at home, like P90X and others) and Sundays would either be a rest day or yoga day.  I’ve used this approach for all my follow-on half marathons (PR 1:36:12) and even my one full marathon (PR 3:45:30).  Another thing I did and continue to do is to not run for a certain time or pace.  Whenever I ran, I ran by feel so I don’t look at my Garmin until the end of the training run.  \n\nThis approach and training plan is definitely NOT for everyone but it worked well for me in the past so I adopted the same approach for this time around as well.  Only exception is I needed hills to train on.  Virginia Beach is flat as a pancake and I despise treadmills so the only place that I could get any kind of hill runs in was at Mount Trashmore.  Mount Trashmore is a city park (landfill reuse) where they have a few sets of stairs that go up to the top, roughly 50-60 feet.  So I trained by going up and down those steps while also running around the park, mixing it up with the frequency of going up and down the steps before taking a break by running the flat loop around the park and then repeating.  I started my 3.5-month training plan in Jan and I did these Mount Trashmore running sessions of varying elevations and distances (both short and long runs) on 16 of 41 total runs leading up to the race.  I gradually increased the elevation numbers, starting at 650 feet total gain on my first run and reaching 2100 feet gain on my last long run.  For my strength training program, I followed Caroline Girvan’s Epic I that’s a free program on Youtube and once a week I would find a yoga program on Youtube as well.  I would also occasionally foam roll (probably should do more than I did).  I trained in Saucony Endorphin Speed 3s but had to retire them by the end of March.  I tried the Speed 4s but the toe box was a little too narrow (not sure why they changed it!) and sizing up by half a size made them too loose, even with a runner’s knot.  Since there were no more Speed 3s in my size, I upgraded to the Endorphin Pro 4s instead which were obviously more pricey and a different plate (carbon vs nylon) but the fit was perfect.  I was able to get in 9 runs with them for a total of 50 miles going into the race.  For reference, here is the monthly mileage I ran leading up to last Saturday’s race:\nJan:  91.1 miles\nFeb:  74.6 miles\nMar:  106.5 miles\nApr:  33.7 miles      \n\n### Pre-race\n\nHeading into the race, I felt I did as much training as I could with what I had at my disposal with Mount Trashmore.  There are two major elevation ascents/descents for this race:  Mill Mountain and Peakwood.  Mill Mountain is two miles to the top while Peakwood is a bit shorter but so much steeper (more about that in the next section).  Problem with my training is that I couldn’t simulate going more than 60 feet at a time.  I got to a point where I was going up and down them 10 times in a row each before continuing on my flat run around the lake and I felt that I built up enough endurance to be semi-successful for the race but truly wouldn’t know until I actually ran it.  My initial goal was to just finish the race and do my best with it.  I figured a sub 2:10 would be a phenomenal time.  I properly tapered off my training for the last two weeks and my legs/body felt really fresh when I arrived for the outdoor expo at Elmwood Park last Friday.  All the volunteers were really friendly and helpful as I picked up my race packet and explored some of the booths that were there.  I carbed up that day by having Panera Bread for lunch (Italian sandwich) and Olive Garden for dinner (fettucine alfredo with shrimp and the zuppa Toscana soup).  I tried to go to sleep early that night but I could hardly sleep.  My Garmin agreed with a very low poor quality sleep score of 45/100 and total duration of 5 hrs 32 mins with lots of tossing and turning.  \n\n### Race\n\nI got up earlier than my 5:30 alarm.  I tried to eat something for breakfast at the hotel lobby but wasn’t really hungry and just ate half of a blueberry muffin.  I drank a 24-ounce hydration drink and shotgunned a 5-hour energy drink before driving over to the parking garage at 6:15 to secure a parking spot.  I then sat in the car distracting myself with my phone until about 7 and then headed over to the dry-bag check-in.  I then tried some warm-up stretches and paced back and forth a bunch of times, eager to get this started.  I felt REALLY good that morning.  Weather was perfect too (my Garmin said 61 but I think it was around 57 at the start), overcast and no sun throughout the race.  I changed my goal with just finishing the race at to finishing it under 2 hours so I walked over and found the 2-hour pacer and stood next to him while waiting for the race to begin.  Race was supposed to have started at 7:35 but they made an announcement that they were having some issues with something (never did get the full story for the delay).  Finally the race started at 7:45 and off we went!\n\nFirst mile was rolling hills until we started ascending up Mill Mountain for two miles.  I felt the climb was a gradual one even though someone told me it was a 10% grade.  The scenery going up was beautiful and I was able to maintain a steady pace going up.  I especially enjoyed punching the super mario theme question mark box signs that spectators held up and seeing another similar box sign with what would pop out shortly thereafter lol!  Eventually we reached the top with the huge Mill Mountain Star that runners were able to pose for pictures if they wanted (I did not), and then we went down!  2 miles back down and I was flying down that mountain on Prospect Avenue back down to the base (you can tell which mile times were the descent).  Again, I wasn’t checking my watch at all like I normally don’t do but there was no doubt I was making excellent time as I made it back down to the bottom.  \n\nThe course then transitioned into friendlier elevation runs along the river and parks for the next couple of miles and I noticed they had a timer display right after mile 6 and I was at 50 minutes.  I figured maybe this race wasn’t so bad after all and I started having visions of a sub 1:45 instead.  Those dreams were quickly vanquished when I reached Peakwood Drive (around mile 8 I think) and the second “mountain” which is a steep climb up through the lovely historic neighborhood of South Roanoke.  Shoutout to all the locals who came out of their beautiful homes to root us all on with creative signs, words of encouragement, and fun chalk messages written on the road.  I remember seeing a mannequin too outside someone’s house that made me laugh.  I tried jogging up it at first, thinking it would be the same as Millwood and boy was I wrong!  It was incredibly steep and for the first time ever I had to walk during a race.  I adopted a walk-run-walk approach.  I was sucking wind harder than I ever have before.  At one point, it flattened out a little bit which to the uneducated (me) about this course would suggest that you are at the top but nope there’s still more to climb.  I saw that I was getting closer when I noticed someone had written “500 feet to go” on the road with chalk.  I walked/ran (mostly walked) every 100 feet until I reached the real top where they had a mimosa “aid” station.  I know this since I grabbed one without realizing, chugged half of it, choked a little, and threw the rest away as I was running their little cul-de-sac before the great descent.  I booked it back down the mountain (err, neighborhood via Rosalind Ave SW) in a full sprint, knowing I needed to make up some time and surprised myself with how well my body held up for those ~two miles.  When I reached the bottom, I thought the rest of the race would be gentler but then I turned down 27th St SW and saw that I had to run up yet another hill on Jefferson St which I just couldn’t do.  It was just as steep as Peakwood and I resigned to walking up it, praying it wasn’t going to be too far.  After reaching the top of Jefferson, I once again sprinted down to mile marker 11 and I then I felt an unpleasant ”twitch” in my right calf.  I shouted out to the high heavens to please not have it seize up and somehow it didn’t but I was cautious from that point on for the last couple of miles, which did include a few bridges to climb again.  Every time I thought that was the last climb, another bridge would appear.  I should have studied the course map more carefully.  My calf twitched again with less than a mile to go but never seized up so I trucked it and never felt so happy with myself when I crossed that finish line and saw my time!\n\n### Post-race\n\nI have to say it again.  The race lived up to its hype.  The post-race party was a blast!  Drank some beer/water/chocolate milk, ate some pizza/bananas/granola bars, and even got some stretching and calf rolling done by some volunteer physical therapists under one of the tents!  My calves, quads, hamstrings, hip flexors were all shot, even two days later they were still a bit sore.  My feet felt great though!  The Endorphin Pro 4s felt amazing throughout the entire race so two thumbs up for this shoe!  There was a music festival too at the park which added to the celebratory atmosphere.  In my view, this was a lot harder than the one flat marathon that I trained and raced strictly due to the elevation stresses that it placed on my body throughout the run.  I don’t think I would ever sign up for this one again, unless I moved to a more hilly or mountainous region where I could train more properly since it became very boring and tedious to run the Mount Trashmore steps.  I’m very proud of myself for the training I did to prepare for this race and for conquering it in the fashion that I did!  My overall placement was 39th out of 836 half-marathon finishers and 5th out of 35 for males (45-49).  My average pace was 8:13 min/mile and according to my Garmin I walked just 4 mins 8 secs of the race (definitely felt longer!).  I give mad respect to those that took on the marathon (double the elevation!) and the double marathon?!?!  I don’t know how we can do it but very impressed nonetheless!  \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "Hey All, long time lurker first time poster.\nIt’s been a couple days since the race but I’ve had the come down and for some reason I’m in sharing mood.\nApologies as all of this is done on mobile, so if the format is terrible then I’ll end up just deleting this.\n\nRace Information\nName: London Marathon\nDate: 21st April 2024\nDistance: 26.2 miles\nLocation: London, UK\nTime: 5:44:47\n\nNow I’ve seen a lot of these and there only seems to be 3 goals listed, so apologies if that’s against the rules or a faux pas, but I had six in mind leading up to this\n\nGoals (in order of priority)\nA: Complete the Run\nB: Complete the run in time to watch the Liverpool match\nC: Finish the run uninjured\nD: Sub 6:30\nE: Have Fun\nF: Sub 6:00\n\nSplits:\n\nContext:\nRight, so I know what you’re probably thinking; do we need another London Marathon race report? And do we need a report for an unimpressive finish time?\nAnd the answer to both is also probably No\nHowever\nI wanted to share this for the sake of anyone new to running, new to their first marathon, and anyone else in between or outside these conditions.\n\nMaybe the majority of redditors here will look at that time and think; “this is another half arsed first attempt at a marathon”\nBut I have some reasons, not excuses, that make me extremely proud of this feat and I may even have some helpful advice for future runners.\nAlthough with that time, a good portion is jogging along with few spots of running.\nI’d say I have excuses, but they’re not, they’re reasons that need context behind the numbers.\n\nSo firstly, this was my first ever marathon.\nAnd I’m incredibly lucky that London was my first go at one considering how many other people also want to participate each year.\n\nI secured my place through my companies partnership with a charity. So there was a team of us fundraising on their behalf, for over about 6 months leading up to it.\n(Still open so I’m unsure of our total £ at the moment, but we’re all happy so far!)\n\nNow I’d done maybe 7-10 half marathons prior, with varying degrees of success.\nThe Dublin Rock n Roll HM was a vibe, as well as both of The Great North Run HM’s, the Liverpool HM where I stayed up till 2am playing co-op Gears of War & drinking rosé the night before was a lowlight, but I digress.\n\nSo I was already pretty confident that I could get around the first 13.1 miles ok at least. It was the other 13.1m that was daunting on me as the challenge.\n\nI looked at a lot of beginner and intermediate training plans, but that start of them always seemed below my ability level & the end above what I thought I could do.\nSo I basically decided to do as many runs, of any distance I could, which admittedly aren’t as far as most here are used to, interspersed with some longer 20k+ runs whenever I could fit them in with recovery time afterwards.\n\nI should probably mention my reasons for being happy with my slow 5:45 time, so let’s start at the start.\nI was born with Cystic Fibrosis, for those unaware, it’s a hereditary genetic condition that is caused by a faulty gene responsible for the production of a protein for the membrane of each cell in the body.\nI’m pretty sure that’s mostly correct, but it’s been a long time since I was diagnosed and i’m not a Doctor or Scientist, just your humble sedentary accountant.\nIt has something to do with chloride ions and osmosis.\nThat’s enough science for now, basically I lose A LOT of salt, primarily through sweat, and this affects a lot of other bodily functions. It’s primarily known as a lung disorder, due to the chronic chest infections and scarring of lunch tissue from them.\nNow luckily, my case isn’t as classic as the majority of those with this, of which I’m equally thankful for and guilty over if I ever bring it up and draw comparisons to those who truly suffer worse.\n\nSo yeah, keeping on top of my salt levels is something I need to check up on if I’m in hot weather conditions, or you know; exercising, especially exercising a lot for a long time.\nWithout enough salt, it makes the mucus inside of me that much thicker which in turn makes it harder to breathe. And I don’t think I need to tell you all how important breathing is to cardiovascular exercise.\nIn my excitement the morning of, I’d forgotten to bring extra salt tablets with me. Luckily at the point during the run that I realised this, I passed a popular chains drive thru/walk through window that was right next to the barrier of the course and they happily provided a handful of sachets for me to add to my water for every other drink.\n\nI think you can see where I’m going with this, but wait, there’s more. Maybe about ten years ago, I had my first experience with an open bar provided by the company credit card, let’s just say this resulted in me dislocating every metatarsal in my right foot.\nThat resulted in two surgeries that left me with two metal plates, a screw, and two pins in order to keep it all together. The pins came out after six weeks but the rest remains to this day.\nOh and I was also hit by a car 10 weeks before the race itself, but that’s another story for another time.\nNeedless to say, everything in the universe tells me that I’m just not built for running, but this was for a great cause, and I’d already entered the ballot unsuccessfully twice before. How could I turn down this opportunity, I’m not one to back down from a challenge so I felt I had the mental aspect locked down.\n\nI’m not a breakfast person, so every Saturday morning park run or any run I start in the AM has never been properly fuelled.\nIn hindsight I could have done a lot better on a lot of my Half Marathons if I’d taken my carb intake seriously.\nKnowing what I was in for, I knew I’d have to up my game, so that’s what I did. The week leading up to it, I pretty much exclusively ate curry & rice for dinner, slowly reducing the protein portion and upping the rice as the days got closer to race day.\nI always thought it was overkill for a HM to bring energy gels, but always felt like I was running on fumes by the end of them.\nI did some online calculators and I took 12 gels with me for the Marathon, along with two packs of fruit pastilles (jelly babies are a great alternative) and ate a pack of Haribo Tangfastics on the walk to the start line.\n(The walk from Greenwich station to Blackheath to blue zone start is very uphill so I do not recommend anyone follow this mistake and get the closest train to your start zone)\n\nThe run itself, I don’t remember much of the landmarks. I mean I’ve been to London before so I wasn’t exactly looking out for them, I had tunnel vision of only what was in front of me because I was so focused on just moving forward. I felt that if I ever stopped, I’d never start again.\nApologies but I couldn’t give you a mile by mile report, because to be honest, each mile was as tough as the last and there’s no sugar coating that.\n\nYou cannot believe the boost you receive from the supporters lining the streets all throughout the course. There’s so many participants running, but there’s even more people out for the day just to cheer on strangers.\nI highly recommend  getting your name printed on your running top you wear on the day, strangers will see this and cheer you on personally. I got this in Newcastle but it wasn’t something I did for London and I sorely missed people shouting me personally to move on.\nThere were so many people with cardboard signs that said something along the lines of “Touch here for an energy boost”\nI’m not sure when or how or why I decided to, but these people had came out to give encouragement to strangers, and I don’t want to disappoint. So every time I saw one of these signs, especially later on when I was taking a walking breather, I’d make sure to hit it (but not hard enough to ruin their sign!) and give an audible “Boop” then run as far as I could out of their line of sight.\nI like to think that it made them glad to have done it, and it definitely helped me push on.\n\nI also cannot stress the importance of a good playlist (if you run with music) as you don’t want to be faffing about changing tracks mid run.\n\nNow if you’ve got this far, congrats to yon and thank you for reading.\n\nIn the end, the combination of; running for a charity, mentally wanting to prove to myself I could do it, massively carb loading in the days before and making sure I was properly hydrated and electrolyte balanced helped me beat most of my goals.\n\nI managed to complete goals A, D and F, so I was absolutely thrilled to see the text when I crossed the finish line saying I did a 5:44:47\nI almost managed goals B and C; I’d tied my right shoe too tight and ended up with a nasty blood blister mid race, which affected my gait and caused me to pull my left groin muscle that leaded to a slower second half of the marathon. I finished in time to watch the second half of the Liverpool match, but by that time I had such a running high & we were already winning that I couldn’t focus on anything but getting back to my hotel.\nI don’t believe many people truly achieve goal E, I think anyone who says otherwise is either a liar or psychopath haha it’s not the run itself that gives the enjoyment it’s the result afterwards (which is AMAZING)\n\nThe TL;DR is\nEnsure you get plenty of carbs in the days leading up to the race, and enough for during it.\nDon’t tie your shoes too tight (or too loose)\nHave a good playlist (if that’s your jam)\nElectrolytes are important even you’re a “healthy” not CF adult\nHave some supporters with you to cheer you on, or have your name printed on you and let strangers do it\nFollow a training plan\nDon’t get hit by a car or have a gammy foot, that just hurts\nTRY to be respectful for where you throw away empty bottles and gels\nWatch out for all of the litter, there will be a lot, especially if you start in the last wave like I did.\n\nThanks for reading, all the best\nSports Lewis"

        "Texto": "I've now completed all 6 of the Majors and spent a bit of time thinking about the races.  My quick thoughts across the board.  Of course, my opinions alone and certainly expect a TON of disagreement.  \n\n**Favorite Overall:**\n\n**New York.**  The course through the 5 boroughs shows off all the aspects of the city, the silence on the bridges, the crowd on first avenue, the last turn into the park, and people of all walks of life lining the streets.  While the 'city doesn't come out' like Boston does the numbers are just staggering.  Travel in/around the city is top notch and the expo isn't too far away or terrible.  Course logistics are well done and serve the race well.\n\n**Least Favorite Overall:**  \n**Tokyo.** The course is simply too many out and backs to really showcase the amazingness of the city of Tokyo.  The people generally seemed to be frustrated the race was there rather than a key show piece of the city.  Both the start and finish felt un-inspiring.  \n\n**Pre-race ancillary BS**  \nBest—Boston by default.  (No one else does a ‘fan fest’. Was not great but existed). \\**Berlin during Oktoberfest is the best BUT not a race event so disqualified.*  \nWorst:  Tokyo.  It seemed like no one knew or cared the race was going on.  Little signage, pop ups, etc.  \nI didn’t find Tracksmith til late, but their stuff is really cool as an ‘every race’ collectible.  \n**EXPO**  \nBest—London at the Excell Center.  Right off the train, easy to get to.  Reasonable selection of local vendors.   \nWorst—Germany.  Was at an old air port.  Half outside. Pain to get to.  Served beer though which makes everything better.   \n\rRace Gear\rBest:  Tie.  Boston and Chicago.  Both have high quality Adidas and Nike gear with a great selection of items on offer.  \nWorst: Germany.  Race doesn’t even include a shirt.  The gear seemed uninspired.  \n**Start Area**  \nBest:  NYC.  Their athletes village has a lot of video screens and content, every wave gets the ‘full’ send off.  I personally like the Staten Island ferry experience but the military precision of the Boston transport is really great.  Just a long time on a bus.    \nWorst:  Tokyo.  Wouldn’t let me bring my own water through security. which made no sense as, well, its  water at a race. Generally quiet and just standing around in corrals for a long time.  \n**Water/course nutrition:**  \nBest: Boston!  Tons of water/gatorade. Both sides of the street.  Great layout and consistent delivery.  \nWorst:  London.  Plastic water bottles given at stops which are just an underfoot hazard.  \n**Course toilets:**\n\nBest:  NYC.  Seems that there were a lot on the course.    \nWorst:  Tokyo.  Leveraged subway toilets mostly…which were hard to see the line, had steps, huge pain in the butt.    \n**Course**  \nBest course (run): Berlin, flat and beautiful  \nBest course (sights/sounds):  NYC, all the sights of the city and the boroughs.  \nBest ‘Moment’:  Boston. Right on Hereford, Left on Boylston, Finish  \nWorst course.  Tokyo; too many out/backs  \n**Crowd**\r\n\nBest:  NYC for the ‘full race’; Boston for the last 8-10 miles.  \nWorst: Tokyo.  \n**Finish**  \nBest:  Boston, it’s Iconic.  London—turning at Buckingham and finishing in the Mall is amazing.  Right into the city and tube.  \nWorst:  Tokyo.  In a government district/fancy shopping.  Pain to get out and not really any ‘excitement’  \n**The ‘City’ for the race:**  Boston.   \nTech for Sign up:\rBest: Boston  \nWorst:  Berlin.  They also had an actual shoe chip shit you had to pay for and give back.   \n**Things people complain about that I didn’t get.**    \nEveryone complains about the walk after finishing NYC.  No one complains about the long walk to start Boston.  The latter is worse than the former.  \n"

        "Texto": "People associate the unicorn mascot in Boston as something unattainable to catch, but we keep trying to get it and it makes us better in the endless pursuit. I completed Boston Monday for my final World Major, after 5.5 years from relearning to walk. \n\nI used to see running as a way to escape my hangovers and clear my body of those toxins with friends and solo, but over the last 5 plus years my relationship with running has changed. \n\nStatistically our relationship should have ended 9/14/2018 when I was running and struck by a car sustaining a severe traumatic brain injury and coma. I awoke out of my coma two weeks later and for a long time…I hated the world I was in. Humans are creatures of habits. I had lost everything. My friends, my girlfriend, my apartment, my license, my smell, my memory, my ability to walk and talk without whispering, no freedom - chained to this invisible injury. \n\nI don’t remember much from my first year, but I remember one night post my first brain surgery that I had to pee.  I decided to try to get up and go to the bathroom. The funny thing is I had a catheter in me, and I of course got it out and tried to walk to a bathroom that probably wasn’t even there. I fell and a handful of nurses came running to me…what were they training for? Definitely not for this. I had to get a scan and make sure my head was ok and more.  But I just remember being on the ground the beeping noises, the bright lights, so hopeless, so disabled, so scared, so depressed, so weak…I wanted to jump out of my own skin - I hated who I was. Was this going to be the rest of my life? \n\nThere are two ways to confront a major life obstacle. You can avoid it or push it to the curb like a lot of people  do….or you can see it as a wake up call - an alarm ingrained in your head - wake up - wake up - you only got this many years on this earth - how do you want this story to go or better yet end? What imprint do you want to leave? Just a piece of sand, a faceless name, someone who just came and left, or someone that changed his life for the better and the lives of others around him for years on end? Well I personally hate sob stories.\n\nRunning gave me a regimented life - \nOne of discipline, desire and dedication. Days when I was down, I’d lace up my shoes, put on the tunes, and forget the noise. I made plans and goals every week and months and I followed them.  No more alcohol or drugs for this guy. The runners high was the only “buzz” I wanted. \n\nI know most of this beast well, hell I have trained and run on most of the course religiously for years for all my races and Boston running groups. The idea is to run the first 20 miles with my head as this is not my first rodeo, but then I’m going to run the final six with my heart as this isn’t just a race. This has been my life. \n\nRunning has given me a chance to challenge my being. All of my life I was scared of doing something major on my own for fear of failure. I wasted so much time trying to please others than to make myself stronger and set goals and tackle them. \n\nRunning has made me a better person. It has shown me sides of human nature I never knew existed. camaraderie, mental toughness, physical toughness, legit blood, sweat and tears; Many lost toenails and even more ruined shoes. \n\nRunning has made me see we are all here on this earth to make a story - one may have some bad parts (hell I know a lot about that), but overall it’s all about progress. One foot in front of the other. Kick push. \n\nAfter my TBI and relearning to walk almost two months, then up to my first run 1/20/19 being watched on a baby monitor, I decided to run the 2019 NYC Marathon - a little over a year after having life turned upside down hit by a car training for it in 2018. We miraculously finished it 11/3/19 in a sluggish pace of 6:08:48 (14:04 pace). But this started my comeback. \n\nThe pandemic came right when I made my first attempt to “chase the unicorn,” but it went virtual. We did it anyways for the first hospital that saved my life, and alongside my little sister and pt whom were my aid runners NYC. We trained through the early pandemic, and on the two year anniversary of my TBI, we made the trek from Hopkinton to my accident site in Cambridge, MA (definitely more like 28 miles). I appreciated the medal, but wanted the real Boston, and it jump started this urge to really want to challenge myself to run the Abbott Six. \n\nI took on Chicago 2021 through a brain injury charity (4:56:39 11.3 pace), then contacted a charity to attempt to chase the unicorn again after…even started doing my first long run; and then wham! My recovery and life came to a halt - I got an infection of my 3d printed chranioplasty skull piece after 3 years and it was removed, along with the probably vascularized dura too bit later (12/2021). The road to the Six Star wasn’t gonna be easy. \n\nHundreds of seizures followed, more inpatient rehab, some outpatient, and I went 352 days of no running, only walking wearing a helmet. I didn’t give up on the Abbotts. \n\nI went hospital to hospital to put my skull and head back together, and I had my 6th and hopefully last brain surgery on 10/14/22. I had gotten in the Berlin Marathon through lottery for 2022, and they gave me the “goodwill offer” to postpone to 2023. My first run came again 11.20.23 for a 1 mile race dressed as a chicken.\n\nIn the mean time, I signed up charity, did the London Marathon April 23, 2023\n5:18:59 (12:15 pace) - anemia was an issue from all of my brain surgeries. \n\nI Finally did the Berlin Marathon September 29, 2023 4:40 (10:34 pace) alongside my brother who ripped out his bib the morning of, surprising me after he had lingered into all my long training runs. \n\nI did Tokyo Marathon March 3rd, 2024 \n4:13:52 (9:41 pace) for charity - my all time PR beating my pre TBI self’s 2016 first marathon (Bay State 4:20). \n\n2024 Boston Marathon Race Report April 15, 2024 - April 15, 2024 04:38:53 (10:38 pace)\nThis weekend was something else. “The Blessing of the Athletes at the Church of the Finish Line”, followed by a shakeout run the day before with hundreds of runners and a dozen of groups on the esplanade all trying to get a last go in before a magical Patriot’s day yesterday. I ran my 6th star in Boston. I witnessed so much inspirational acts of gratitude and perseverance from aids and runners alike in that sauna of a race. Saw a blind six star runner with his wife guiding him, people with one leg, so much pain and so much happiness. All of the majors have their own quirks and cultures, but being from MA and running for one of the hospitals that majorly attributed to effects of the bombing made this my favorite I’ll ever run. The crowd at Boston College was incredible and the final 1.5 miles…my watch had died and I had anger, frustration, obviously loss of breath, but the crowd made me realize why I had devoted my life to running the Abbott 6 after my own trauma and life upheaval/injury I went through in 2018 and Boston hospitals saved my life. \n\nCost and qualifying obviously a major factor in deciding to run Boston, but the feeling I felt the final mile with the loud Boston crowd to holding my sister’s hand (also was going for 6) after the right turn on Hereford, left on Boylston will always be my proudest moment of my life. No better feeling than feeling Boston Strong. \n\nAt the end, we got Six Star medal and went to get photos at Abbott majors and I started seeing flashing lights and almost fainted. Then my sister felt horrible too. They gave us ice packs and we resurrected. Overall my favorite marathon I’ve run due to the crowd, it’s my city, and the challenges of it all. I want to run it again!\n\nMy first Six Star journey has ended, but this was more than just running and medals. This experience shaped me into a stronger person who is willing to put in the work to tackle any obstacle or life event, however many “miles” it takes.  I hope my journey can add some extra pep into your next run without just a carbon plate. I almost died while running, but running also gave me a new life, and I wouldn’t change a thing.\n\nPhoto collage journey - https://imgur.com/a/hV3yOLf"

        "Texto": "I think one of the biggest barriers for people who want to start running is finding a strong enough motivator to get out there day after day, week after week. For a lot of running folks I know (me included) the early days of taking up the routine can be filled with a lot of dread anticipating the struggle you're about to put yourself through.   \nI know for me, I used to have a LOT of days where I wouldn't even WANT to be running until about two kilometers in when I started to feel like I'd hit my stride. I'd have to struggle to find a reason to even *start* on any given day! Fortunately, I had a two-fold motivation strong enough to carry me for multiple years: \n\n1. **An Excuse to Leave The House.**  For context, I started running in March 2020, around the time the United States went into quarantine. As someone who lives alone, looking forward at the prospect of near-total isolation for God knows how long, I knew if I didn't find SOMETHING things would get Bad for me, and *fast.* Fortunately, government guidance on quarantine at the time provided generous allowances for folks who were going out for the sake of working out, provided they were doing it outdoors...\n2. **Cliffhangers**. When I first started, My friend recommended I use Zombies, Run! as my tracker instead of the more popular recommendations. It wasn't long until I got really attached to the characters in the app's ongoing story, Sam in particular. Now, the real genius of the writing behind Zombies, Run's mission structure is that they'd more often than not end chapters on some kind of devastating cliffhanger--meaning if you want to know if Sam and Jody and Janine get out of a particular situation okay, *guess what you gotta do.* I'm enough of a massive nerd that that kind of psychological trick works FAR too well on me. \n\nNow it's four years later. We're all out of quarantine and although I've started it from Season 1 again, I've pretty much completed every chapter of the story in the app at this point. But after four years I've found my body WANTS the activity enough that I get kind of tetchy if I don't go out 4-5 days a week. I've even found myself using running *itself* as a motivator for making other improvements in my life. I've lost 55 pounds in the last year just because I found myself thinking last January that I might be able to improve my times if I did. (Turns out I was right--I'm habitually pulling 10k in under an hour for the first time in my life!) But it's funny--before I started running, my family would actually make comments about my weight fairly regularly, thinking THAT would motivate me. But, surprise surprise, it didn't. If anything, I'd find myself doubling down on old bad habits almost out of spite instead.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, obviously, and it got me thinking about those initial motivators to get me putting on a pair of shoes. If I hadn't found ones that worked for me and how my mind works, I probably wouldn't have even started. So I'm curious about all of you, and your thoughts on motivation and the finding thereof. What was the thought in your head that actually got you to start running? Is it the same as what gets you going now? What motivations actually make you want to go *less?* "

I was big into cycling last summer but when temperatures got too cold, I switched to running. I had already been running 1-2 times per week but very short distances (3-5 mi) with no real plan. In the fall, I decided to run a marathon given I had 4-5 months to prepare. I got into the Boston Marathon by running for a charity. I had never run a race before. I get lots of running injuries anytime I try to increase volume so my biggest worry was staying injury-free. I dedicated lots of time to strengthening, stretching, mobility, and plyometrics to make sure my legs could handle training. \n\nI followed Hal Higdon's 3-day a week plan with some modifications -- most notably, cut from three 20 mile long runs to just one. Overall the Higdon plan is 5 workouts per week (3x running, 2x cross). I also kept my normal lifting schedule (bodybuilding-focused) of 4x/week so it was a lot of work on my body but I tried to make it work. About halfway into the plan I got shin splints. I saw a PT who helped me change my foot strike. It fixed my shin splints but ended up causing runner's knee. I was able to solve that with strength and plyometrics.\n\nRunning through the NYC winter sucked, especially since I run first thing in the morning when temps are coldest, but I didn't skip any workouts. Discipline > motivation. \n\nMy easy pace is around 10:30-11min/mile so was shooting for a 4:30hr goal time. \n\n### Pre-race\nGot into Boston on Saturday -- an easy train ride up from NYC. Ate lots of carbs (Chicken Yaki Udon, Pad Thai, Spaghetti, Bagels). \n\nMorning of the race was my biggest concern. I usually run fasted without caffeine at 6am, but since the start time is 11:15am I knew I would have to have both food and caffeine to make it through the day. For breakfast, I had coffee with a bagel with peanut butter and banana with some electrolytes. I also ate a Clif Bar about an hour before the race. \n\nThe buses dropped me off in Athlete's Village at 10:25am. I thought I would have lots of time to warm up and get changed but they called my wave at 10:40am, just 15 mins later. All I had time to do was go to the bathroom and change my shoes and do some light active mobility. I felt rushed and wasn't mentally prepared. It was a 0.7 mile walk to the start line where I was really nervous as it was my first RACE not even just first marathon. I had no idea what to expect. My heart was racing while standing in the corall with 5 mins to go.\n\n\n### Race\nMy gameplan was to break up the race into three chunks. Miles 1-10: run easy and treat it as an extended warmup. Miles 11 - 21: use my fitness I developed in training to pick up the pace slightly and make it through Newton Hills. Miles 21+: give it all I have left with my heart.\n\nIn reality, this all went out the window.\n\nHere are the challenges I faced immediately out of the gate:\n\nThe first challenge was the heat. It was 70 degrees and sunny. I had done all my training under 40 degrees so I was not used to this at all. Out of the gate, I felt dizzy and was worried I would develop more serious heat exhaustion.\n\nThe second challenge was food. I was nauseous from the start since my stomach wasn’t used to all this food before running.\n\nThe third challenge was how crowded it was. I was in the last wave so lots of slower runners so the entire first 2-3 miles was just weaving around and through people and trying to find some open space to run in a straight line. I wasted so much energy.\n\nThe fourth challenge was water. I usually run with a running vest and sip pretty often, a few times every mile. I wasn’t used to only having a tiny cup of water once every mile. My mouth was dry and I was dying for more water.\n\n**By mile 5**, I was already gassed. I realized I had gone out way too fast and there was no way I could hold this pace for the race so I would need to slow down. I was planning on running 10 min/mile for the first 10 miles but I looked at my watch and my average pace was already like 9 min/mile. This is really fast to me and I was freaking out what to do. I knew I had to slow down.\n\n**Miles 5 - 10**: I felt less nauseous and better with the heat. I actually felt good but had trouble slowing down with all the energy from the crowds. There weren’t really any hills here and so I was cruising along at ~8:45min/mi pace. It was still hard but I was just trying to get to mile 10 where I had planned to put in my headphones and listen to music to give myself a boost.\n\n**Miles 10-13**: I put in headphones and turned on some music. I’m starting to struggle but told myself I just need to get to halfway. ~8:30min/mi pace. This is basically threshold for me. I usually do my interval runs at this pace. \n\n**Miles 13-16**: Just holding steady awaiting the Newton Hills. Somehow going even faster I don’t even know how. ~8:15min/mi pace.\n\n**Miles 16-21**: Dear lord what the fuck.. The hills are way bigger than I imagined. I’m do my training in Central Park in NYC so figured they would be similar to that but I was wrong, they seemed much longer. My legs start cramping. My inner thigh, quads, and calves are spasming. I knew that if I stop or walk, my race is going to be over. I don’t think I’d be able to get my legs working again so I just run through all the pain. I’m downing salt pills and taking an extra gel here to make sure I am getting enough fuel. I start taking Gatordade and Water at the aid stations. It feels like I’m going at 15 min/mi pace but somehow my watch is telling me ~9 min/mi. \n\n**Miles 21-25**: It somehow gets even worse. I only have ~5 miles left but I know there is no way my legs will hold on for another ~45 mins. It will only take 1 really bad cramp to just completely derail me and force me to walk. I’m downing gels and salt pills. I’m gritting my teeth. My legs feel detached from my body. Every time my foot slams the pavement I feel my muscles spasm. Everything is tight. I’m weaving through a sea of people walking and limping like I’m in a zombie movie. I wouldn’t wish this feeling on my worst enemy. I tell myself that this is what I asked for and these 5 miles are what the last 6 months have been about. Holding on for dear life at 9:30 min/mi.\n\n**Mile 26**: With only 1 mile to go, I felt much better. I knew it was only going to be ~10 mins more of pain and the crowds were getting so loud. Once I could see the finish line it was way easier. \n\nI look at my watch and somehow see my finish time starts with a “3”. I’m blown away. Every race predictor and calculator I used online told me to shoot for a 4:30. I even made a reddit post a few weeks ago asking my goal pace and was told a 4:20-4:30 is where I should be targeting. I smashed that by like 30 minutes. \n\n**This was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life. I gave it everything I had and couldn't have gone a second faster. I left it all out there and was ready to die on the course in that last 10k.**  This was a 4 hour battle of dehydration, nausea, cramping, heat, weaving through crowds, downhills, and uphills. \n\n### Post-race\nThe sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. I felt like crying honestly. I waddled through with the other finishers to get some water, pick up my medal, and find my gf. We grabbed some Shake Shack and hop on the Amtrak back to NYC."

I suspect some got knocked over by the wind and some I just missed. I marked the unknown split times with asterisks and filled in these times with what's in Strava, adding 7 seconds since that seems about the average extra time for the miles I manually split*\n\n### Background/Training\n45M late starter. I started running races in 2017 and started training for marathons in 2021. This was my 4th since Nov 2021. In the fall of 2022 I ran 3:56 in Philadelphia with a 4 minute negative split and spent the last couple miles in an ecstatic runners high that I've never felt the likes of since. In the fall of 2023 I ran 3:41:11 in Richmond with a 90s positive split and spent the last 3 or 4 miles slowing down and miserable on the razors edge of my legs locking up. At one point I kicked a water bottle down the street multiple times because I couldn't lift my feet high enough to clear it. As I went into this race my goal was a happy medium, finish strong without leaving so much in the tank. \n\nFor Richmond I did a cycle of Pfitz 55/18 and ended up so exhausted that I was telling everyone I was going to reevaluate my life choices after the marathon. As soon as the Marathon was done and I'd spent a couple weeks relaxing I went right back to training. I spent a month lifting twice a week and building my mileage back up and then put together my own 15 week plan based on Run Faster by Brad Hudson. My workload was manageable but I don't think I've figured out how to build a great plan for myself yet and my progression was uneven. Then about 8 weeks from the race I caught the flu, took an entire week off and ran easy another week and it was about a month before I was running as well as I had been. All told I seem to have ended up about as fit as I had been at the end of the Pfitz cycle. I set my sights on a modest new PR and breaking 3:40 and chose 8:23/mile as a target pace. I also gave myself a talking to about staying well under LT HR and no higher than upper zone 3 until sometime after mile 16. I told myself the job was to get myself to mile 20 within sight of my goal and still strong enough to push hard the last 10k. \n\n### Pre-race\nOver the previous cycles I've learned that feeling terrible is what I do during tapers. I always end up convinced that I'm sick or hurt and that the race will be a disaster. Like the last two cycles I carb loaded by eating ~615g carbs for the 3 days before the race which seems to vanquish the wall on race day but also makes me feel cracked out and vaguely sweaty until I'm running it. I also upped my carb intake during the race, taking a gel every 3 miles rather than 4 and grabbing the sports drink rather than water when it was available. It was roughly 60g/hour, probably a hair less.\n\nMy yard was horrific and I didn't feel like I could spend another weekend not mowing it so I did that Friday after work. I deeply regretted it Saturday morning when I woke up with the sniffles (it's peak pollening in Virginia) and a Garmin body battery of 66. I resolved not to look at that again until after the race. \n\nThe traffic on the drive up was terrible and we took about 7 hours getting to Jersey City. We walked to an upscale Mexican restaurant for dinner. On the walk back I was freezing and the wind seemed like it was all gust. Despite the air temperature being in the mid 50s everyone I saw running was in tights and/or jackets. I started to feel completely unprepared for the conditions. I didn't have the clothes for the pre-race conditions, maybe not for the race itself and I was totally unprepared mentally to run in that kind of wind.\n\nFortunately none of that came to pass. The next morning brought a gentle breeze and the temperature felt pleasantly cool when I left at 5:40 wearing a sacrificial flannel and ski cap. I discovered that the light rail I was expecting to take from Exchange Place wasn't running so I walked/trotted the mile over to the start and made it part of my warmup. Getting in was super easy I just joined the throngs milling about and got into my corral at 6:45. \n\n### Race\nAll the corrals started at 7. For the first couple miles I felt packed in like a sardine. The first two miles ticked by exactly on pace, making me suspicious of my watch. Also suspicious was that the 3:45 pacer and, briefly in mile 2, also the 3:55 pacer were both in front of me but as best I could tell I was on pace so I pushed on, eventually passing the 3:45 pacer sometime before mile 5. We did some climbing around miles 5 or 6 and while I slowed down some to keep my effort steady but you can't really see it in the splits. Most of the climbing on this course seems concentrated in a small handful of rolling hills in this section. In the direction we ran for the first loop they're pretty short and moderately steepish followed by a long gentle downhill. The crowds thinned out as we left downtown and we ran past cemeteries and a park with occasional views of Manhattan. I probably could have enjoyed these more but my focus was on the road.\n\nFrom 7 to the half there were a couple spurts of over-exuberance but I mostly stayed on plan. In this section I started to feel like the laces across the top of the tongue on my right shoe (Speed 3s) were too tight. I'd agonized over trying to get these tight enough to achieve a little more heel lock without being too tight and they ended up being too tight. In mile 11 I stopped and loosened them, hoping to fix the issue before it became agonizing and lost about 20 seconds.  \n\nAs we came back into the city at the end of the first loop all of the half marathoners around me were giving everything they had left at the exact same time that I was trying to get calm and collected for the next stretch. It was fun seeing the crowds again and I gave kids high fives and slapped powerups. The sun was starting to be more of a factor now. I was trying to run in the shaded part of the street whenever there was one. Thankfully I was able to collect the sunglasses I'd left at the hotel from my wife near the half. I turned in a few slower splits as I strove to keep my effort under control. We were climbing the hills from the first lap in reverse now and they were much longer and gradual in this direction. I compared my time at mile 19 to what I'd written on my hand before the race and thought I was about a minute behind my target. \n\nWhen I got to 20 I didn't feel amazing like I did at Philadelphia. I was tired. But I also felt like I had enough strength left to pick it up so I turned my legs over a little faster and started picking people to reel in. The next two splits were 15-20 seconds over target and felt good. Around mile 23-24 it started to feel really hard. My impression at the time was that I was slowing down a lot as we approached the finish but except for the split at 23 I was above target the whole way. The sun felt brutal at this point and I was running right on the edge of wanting to throw up. It felt like the finish line would never come until finally I crossed, just 3 seconds shy of my A-goal. \n\n### Post-race\nI'm really satisfied with how I executed this time around. According to the numbers in Strava I ended up with a 31s positive split. I was able to race across the finish line rather than dragging myself across it like I did in the fall but I don't feel like I left any time on the course other than the time I spent retying my shoe. I'm looking forward to trying to do the same again this fall after hopefully a more progressive training block. I'm thinking October race, maybe Toronto or Detroit. I'm going to leave the training to the experts this time, I'm thinking JD 2Q plan. \n\nI won't hesitate to recommend Jersey City. I enjoyed spending the weekend there, eating good food and enjoying great views. The after-race support was great. They handed me both water and an electrolyte drink with protein and offered me fruit and granola bars. Instead of handing me the medal they put it over my head and similarly draped a heat blanket over my shoulders. It felt personal and kind. I had a couple nitpicks with the race itself, a wave start might have reduced the packed sardine feeling at the start, I wish there had been a timing mat at the half, and it was a bummer that the runner progress notifications didn't work and the race wasn't on racejoy. But like I said that's just nitpicks and minor for it being just the second running. I had a great time racing here. \n\nIf you've made it this far thanks for reading!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

I took 5 days off completely and started easing back into running. I targeted the Cheap Marathon as my goal race seeing the very gradual rolling hills and time trial start as a good race to PR. I wanted to bump up my milage from Pfitz, but wanted more flexibility in my plan so I chose Jack Daniels 2Q for this training cycle.  \nThe first few weeks kicked my butt as the Q sessions felt tougher than most Pfitz workouts and I was running my E miles on fairly hilly routes. I started to burnout a bit so I took the first \"bolded\" workout as an E day and started running most of my E days on much flatter routes.  \nAfter about 6 or 7 weeks into the 2Q plan I adapted and was able to execute the workouts.  My milage was taking up and I hit my first 100 mile week. I completed most of my Q sessions on the local greenway to avoid street traffic, unless it was really rainy where to Greenway floods out and I run in the hillier parts of town. I enjoyed the flexibility of Daniels program as I could fit E miles to my schedule. I doubled most Sunday, Mondays and Fridays when I was around peak milage.  \nA week out from Cheap Marathon the weather forecast called for a Spring Nor'easter. The snow from the storm ended up cancelling the scheduled race date so I targeted my backup race, the Coastal Delaware Running Festival Marathon, which fell a 8 days after my original target race date. I more or less reset my plan back from the new race date. It was basically an extra week of taper which my legs didn't mind, but did worry me about losing a bit of marathon distance since it pushed me further away from my last few longer runs, 18+ miles.  \nRace  \nThe weather for the race was quite good, starting around 50°F  considering how windy it was the day before and later that afternoon,  so I appreciated the 7 AM start time. I arrived at the boardwalk which is where the start and finish line was about an hour before the start. I used the restroom a final time, laced up my race shoes (Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris), downed a caffeine gel, and jogged towards the start as my warmup. I lined up towards the front since my goal time would have been top 10 in the previous year. The race started promptly on time which is always appreciated.  \nFirst few miles were on the roads through the beach neighborhood and then headed to the nearby State Park. Once in the park the path became crushed gravel, which I didn't really train on since I planned on running cheap marathon. The surface didn't cause any real issues, but I could feel a tad bit of slippage in my toe off compared to running on pavement. There was a section that ran over elevated boardwalk and the later sections were paved. The views were beautiful in the park, so it made up for the sparse crowd support. The park had a couple very small hills and a few twists and turns that slowed down the pace, but overall a scenic and interesting part of the course.  \nExiting the park we ran towards Lewes beach on a paved greenway trail that headed dead straight for several miles at a time. At Lewes Beach we had an out and back that ran parallel to the coast during which the course hit the halfway point. Leaving Lewes we transitioned to running on the road, crossed a  bridge which was the last real hill, and faced a  decent headwind but thankfully it was not too bad.  \nAid stations were spaced about every 2 miles stocked with water and Gatorade. There were a couple with gels, but I carried all of my own nutrition so I only grabbed water/Gatorade. I took a total of 6 SIS beta fuel gels with me on the course, 2 of which we caffeine, every other aid station.  The gels always weigh down my shorts in the early parts of the race, but naturally get lighter as I progress. I had a few salt stick tabs too that I took around the halfway point.  \nAbout mile 18 I was feeling quite full from my nutrition, starting to feel the fatigue, and fell the bright sun as it was warming up a good bit. My training prepared me well though because I had felt quite similarly quite often during my Q sessions during my training, minus the warmth since I trained through the winter. There were several final miles that returned back to crushed gravel. I was worried that now with more tired legs that this could cause me issues. I had my left calf flare up with the warning signs of a cramp. When this would happen I'd ease up for about 10 strides and let my right leg take the lead. Fortunately it never seized up, which had happened twice during my training cycle.  \nThe final 2 miles or so of the race returned to pavement thankfully and I focused on holding my pace as best I could and closing out. The last half mile merged with the half marathoners which were running a bit slower so there was some maneuvering required. At that point I was emptying the tank with everything I had just wanting to finish and save every second that I could. I crossed the finish line relieved to be finished!  \nPost-race  \nI was handed a hat, water bottle, and given my finisher medal. I was quite happy with my time In all of my marathons now I usually finish about minutes slower that how I set my splits. my first marathon I was surprised, but there is always some sort of slow down either with aid stations, fatigue, or general race confusion. Hopefully I have enough cushion to get into Boston, but you really never know especially since there have been so many fast times at big races this qualifying period."

Sorry that this is SO LONG, everyone - no one told me talking about your races was this addictive!\n\n**Background:**\n\nA year ago, I heard someone (a marathon running) bragging online about how running a marathon isn't for everyone, how it takes someone special to do it. This annoyed me (well, to be fair it's more that I dislike the person who said it and am always prone to be annoyed by anything they say... but still). I am not a runner, I have never been a runner, but I remember thinking *I bet he is wrong*. I felt like running a marathon could indeed be for everyone, provided the person somehow arrived at that goal. So I asked my partner, *hey, is it crazy if I try to run a half marathon?* My partner thought I should at least start with a 10k (again - zero running experience here!), and so I ran with him for a couple months, and I got better, and I sucked at it but eventually went and ran my first 10k (in under one hour, my goal - yay!).\n\nI hated the experience of training for that race, though, because I was running with someone more fit and more experienced, and felt like I was always running at a pace I wasn't comfortable with. I finished every run feeling like *there is no way I can run 10k, not like this*. So when that first official race was over and some time went by, I started to court the idea of beginning another training plan, but at my own rhythm - a rhythm that would allow me to appreciate my runs and just not suffer through them. But I needed to be training for something, and so, last October, I decided I would try and run a half marathon in 6 months.\n\nLooking back at these 6 months, I feel incredible proud of myself. I ran 3 to 4 times a week with almost no exceptions. I ran when I didn't want to. I left the house when I could have stayed in, when I wanted to stay in. Most of my runs were by myself and sometimes that felt extra hard, but at the same time, how cool was it to show myself that I was able to step up FOR myself, to do what it takes even when I didn't want to and nobody would make me?\n\nGradually, I felt this magical mental shift start happening. My previous long runs had all been at most 8k, and now I was starting to look at an 8k run as a small run. Anything under 12k, I just went and did it - 12k was not a small run, but also not a major milestone in my mind, not anymore. I ran 18k a couple times (three or four, i think) - most of them with a five-forty-something pace, even though I was not pushing for any specific pace and just trying to run that distance. I was getting better, getting a bit faster. I told everyone I would be running a half marathon and I felt absolutely confident that I would be finishing it. I started dreaming of a sub 2H finish. I bought some running shoes along the way - the Saucony Race 16 - and that made all the difference, love them, my calves were constantly hurting in the weeks before buying these shoes and that never happened again.\n\n**Race Day:**\n\nThis being my first long-ish distance run, there were a couple things I was unsure about and kinda messed up. For instance, should I run the day before? I did (just 3km, slow-ish, but wonder if that hindered me). Also, I usually wait a lot of time between a full meal and a run (just feels better that way for me personally), and I had breakfast just about 1H30 before my run - mistake #1. Then luck would have it that we had one of the hottest days of the year so far, and I find it difficult to drink during my runs - but I had to drink anyway since I was feeling super dehydrated. And then - biggest, silliest mistake ever, that maybe cost me my goal - the race began, and it was beautiful to be running on the bridge, and the energy was so good, and we were also running downhill - and I just went with it and didn't think about pacing myself.\n\n**First 5k:**\n\nRan the first kilometer at a 5:21 pace. The second, at 5:06 and the third at 5:09. I was feeling good, great even, and I was so sure that I would feel that way through the run! Super confident about my sub 2H goal. (I should perhaps mention that I don't have a watch (tried running with a borrowed Garmin and it kept overestimating my pace, to the point where it was so frustrating that I gave up and went back to running with my phone only. The downside of this: I only know how fast I'm going at each kilometer...) I hit a 5k PR of 26:24, was feeling great... And then the downhill stopped, the \"fun\" part of the race was over, and we began the \"straight\" part of the race.\n\n**Kilometers 6 to 11:**\n\nStill feeling good, but starting to feel my legs a bit heavier than I'd like (I blame the previous evening run!). I missed a powerade aid station which could perhaps have helped... And then I started realizing that I was not even halfway there yet, that it would not be getting any easier. And then...\n\n**Kilometers 12 to 15:**\n\nI arrived to the truly boring part of the race. Just a straight line, no ups and downs whatsoever - which I realize it's probably a blessing for so many people, and perhaps what makes this race a fast race, but I just find it so boring! It felt like I was running that straight road for *ages*. Mentally, I started hitting a wall. I was barely half way there. I had to keep running for almost another hour. I was hurting, I was hurting, I was hurting. My lovely partner was joining me at the 15 kilometer to run the last 6k with me and add some moral support, and so I told myself that I only had to make it to kilometer 15 and focused on getting there. Still possible to run the race under 2H but at this point I am just trying to survive.\n\n**Kilometers 16 to 21:**\n\nMentally, I am in the gutter. I did not think I would feel like this on race day. I am so tired, I can't believe I have more than 5k to go still. That's like a half hour of running. How the hell will I do that? It feels so far away. My partner being there helps, and since I told everyone I would be finishing this I *really* want to finish this, but I just feel despair. I try to take it one kilometer at the time - *just make it to kilometer 17... Good. Okay, you did it, now just make to kilometer 18...* I feel my sub 2H goal just slipping through my fingers and that saddens me  so much but for the life of me I have nothing more to give. Kilometer 20 arrives and I just feel despair that there's still another quilometer to go.\n\nFinally we're getting close to the finishing line but it still feels so far away. I don't have the energy for anything more than just try and keep running. I feel myself slowing down with each kilometer and I feel there's nothing I can do about that. I cross the finish line in despair (but holding my partner's hand - victorious!). I can barely breathe and I find a place on the shade to lay down. I am never ever doing this again...\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n... or am I? Not a week had passed and already the pain was (mostly) forgotten. I am already dreaming of my next half marathon. (Perhaps one where I don't give it all in the first quarter of the run.)\n\nI am excited to run in other countries, as I feel that there wasn't much support on the streets and that could have made a difference. I feel a bit sad that I didn't get that sub 2H time, but I did run 21k!! Ten of those with the biggest mental block of my whole damn life, and I didn't stop, didn't give up. How incredibly cool is that?\n\nI do feel like I sacrificed an enjoyable run for the hope of finishing under 2H, and I wish I hadn't done that. Looking back, I think it would have been better to go in with just the goal of finishing the race and enjoying myself. I finished the race in absolute despair, and I really really wanted to have finished feeling strong and confident. Oh well - live and learn!\n\nFor the next couple months, I think I'll try and add some speed work to my runs, and also go on long runs that are more than the half marathon distance, so I get mentally used to the 21k. Overall though - I feel hooked. I wonder if I'll ever end up running a full marathon..."

At the time, I was training for what was supposed to be my first marathon, and the race was just a couple weeks away. I had just completed a 20 mile run. In the hospital for the better part of a month, they set my expectations by letting me know I wouldn't run again. Well, I'm here to tell you - I'M BACK BABY! And I still have my sights on completing that marathon...\n\nSome things I've learned in recovery:\n\n1. Cycling (for knee/leg/ankle rehab) is HUGE. A tremendous amount of work in this area changed my trajectory and enabled jogging and eventually running again.\n2. It takes TIME. A lot of trying, failing, being sidelined, working through pain, physical therapy, strength training, patience, listening to the body, and KEEPING MOVING is what worked for me.\n3. Not every doctor or PT's opinion is the gospel truth.\n\nPre-race:   \nI've been training to complete a 'half-Ironman' triathlon because the lower impact of swimming and cycling is more sustainable for my body at the moment, and is actually helping me get back to pure running. In triathlon training, I'm running 3 days a week, but this is supplemented with 3 days a week of cycling and swimming also, including a long weekly bike ride.\n\nIn the build up to this race, I completed an 11 mile run in ripping winds, a 10 mile run, and several 8-9 mile runs. My overall running volume hasn't been very high, however, and this would be my first time going half marathon distance since my accident. The race capped off my fourth consecutive 20 mile week. Prior to that I had a lot of 10ish mile weeks, followed by three 14-16 mile weeks. Most of my running has been done at a 'easy'-moderate intensity and only recently have I begun to incorporate a small amount of speed work.\n\nWhat I have discovered is a lot of bike fitness (and maybe even some swim fitness) does transfer to running. Aerobically I feel remarkably fit given my low running milage, and I'd been feeling ready to temperature test some higher intensity running. I knew I could at least complete half marathon distance at this point, so i wanted to celebrate the milestone by doing it in a race environment.\n\nRace:   \nAs this was the first time I'd be putting on a bib since the accident, I found myself weirdly nervous. I knew I didn't have the fitness to be racing to the best of my ability, and the main goal was just completing it, but I still had a ton of feelings and excitement circulating about returning to running. I slept poorly the night before after loading up a on a carb heavy dinner and a lot of electrolytes and hydrating.\n\nAt 6 am I ate a bagel and cream cheese and a banana. At 6:30 I started drinking coffee and hydrating with more electrolytes. The gun was at 8 am and the course was very close to my house so an easy short drive. My Dad and wife came to cheer me on, which was awesome.\n\nI opted to run in just my daily trainers - Brooks Glycerins with an arch insert, which provide some cushion/support for my knee. My Saucony Endorphin Speeds (V1) which I used to love pre-accident no longer fit my feet in the same way, and I resisted the urge to go crazy and try a new super shoe given my objectives.\n\nI kitted up and did a short warmup and some stretching. It was a two loop course around Boulder Reservoir and I'd run the exact course in training. My plan was to go out easy especially for the first loop, and I didn't want to run faster than 8:30s. I'm always amazed how many people seem to get excited on race day and go out too fast. The first loop went well and I was feeling good and had stuck to my pacing so far. Tons of casual conversations were happening around me which I found funny, but as we got deeper in things started to thin out, and I finally shook two girls having the most annoying mid-race chat ever \"Remember that guy who kissed my neck here?! Oh my god he was so weird!\". I ate a marten 100 gel at +30 minutes.\n\nLoop 2 started as I passed my Dad and wife and it was time to throttle up a little. Now the race had begun. I'd set some mental markers about where in the course I'd start pushing harder. I started picking people off and I don't think I got passed on the second loop except by one guy whom I was definitely racing with for about a mile and half. He ignored my \"good work man\" comment. I ate a second maurten gel at +1:10, and hit a couple aid stations for a splash of water or gatorade on a fly by without breaking my stride. As the miles went on, I continued to throttle up, and wound up running the second loop over 4 minutes faster than the first. I gave a big push for the last 5k and completed my last 3 miles at sub-8 minute pace.\n\nI crossed the finish line working very hard and feeling ecstatic.\n\nPost-race:    \nThis race was a huge milestone for me so I thought it would be fun to memorialize it in this write up. Afterwards, we grabbed breakfast, beignets and a bloody mary at Lucilles, my favorite cajun breakfast joint in town. My legs feel pretty beat up but I'm super pleased with the result and am more fired up than ever before about running.\n\nThe Half-ironman is on the calendar for June 8 and uses the same run course, so it was neat to get a dry run. Once that's over, I think I'll be ready to assess if a fall marathon this year could potentially be in the cards..... And if so, maybe I'll finally splash out on some real racing shoes.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nMade with a new race report generator created by u/herumph."

        "Texto": "I bought my first pair of Altras about a month and a half ago. I walked out of the shop wearing them and have been wearing them as much as I can since.\n\nFirstly, a day after buying them, I couldn't go back to my normal runners, my pinkie and foot in general felt cramped, so beware.\n\nI've ran 200km and used them for everyday walking on top of that. I'd say 70% trails and 30% pavement. They're extremely comfortable, zero drop and have a wide toe box, wearing them feels like you've got some something around your ankles, but the rest of your foot is free and doesn't feel like it's touching the runners at all.\n\nI've heard a couple of people say that they wear out somewhat quickly, but even with some pavement running, there's only a tiny bit of wear on the sole, on the outside of the heel.\n\nI got my wife to try a pair, and she loves them as well. I'll be getting an Escalante pair for pavement.\n\nOverall, I'm completely sold, they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had, and being zero drop, I'm trusting that with my hopefully improving running technique, they'll help me avoid injuries as well.\n\n10/10, still look brand new, easy to wash and dry quickly.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/DJurkFF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DJurkFF.jpg)  \n[https://i.imgur.com/Luj4QEN.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Luj4QEN.jpg)"

In each of the other 3 I had some sort of issue during the race that left me walking a good portion of the 2nd half. I tried a few different plans for my other marathons and felt like they weren't working for me. I felt they were either too low milage or light on speed work. At the end of last year I bought Daniels, Pfitzinger and Hanson's books. I read through all of them and decided to go with Hanson's beginner plan. My other plans all capped out in the mid to high 40s milage wise. Hanson's beginner has 9 weeks that were more than others I tried. The last 6 weeks before the taper were all 50+ miles. I did over 200 miles in Feb and Mar. This plan has runs 6 days a week with 1 rest day. There's 3 days a week that are something other than an easy run. One day that starts are shorter interval 400m, 600m, etc. repeats with 400m recoveries. About half way that switches to a longer interval pyramid 6x1m, 4x1.5m, 3x2mi, 2x3mi and back down. There's also a tempo run day and long runs. The main substantial difference between Hanson's and most other plans is the long runs peak at 16mi instead of 20mi. I figured since I've done a few marathons I would be fine with the shorter long runs.\n\nTraining went really well. The last few tempo runs felt easy and my Garmin even tagged them as easy since I was in Z2, the top of Z2, the whole run except for the few hills. The last long run I did as a fast finish and was able to pick up the pace to race pace for the last 4 miles.\n\n### Pre-race\nI kept looking at the weather and it was looking kind of iffy 10 days out. One day the weather app would show rain, the next it showed clear. Finally a few days before it started looking pretty good. Clear, starting in the low 40s with a high in the upper 60s.\n\nI flew in on Thursday afternoon since the race was on Saturday and the expo was Friday. Had to get up at 5:00AM to make my 7:45 flight. That was actually a good thing since it helped me get onto eastern time. Of course when I landed it was raining with flood warnings because it had been raining a lot for days. Went to the store to pick up some stuff I didn't bring with me because I didn't want to check luggage. Got up Friday morning to do a shakeout run and more rain! I waited until around 8:00 then decided running in the rain wouldn't be too bad because it was reasonably warm. Got a little lost on the run and wound up running up and down a steep hill in waterlogged shoes. Not something I recommend unless you enjoy your feet sliding around in your shoes. After I picked up my stuff at the expo did a bit of sightseeing, mostly driving, since I've never been to Indiana before. I waited too long to get dinner reservations so got some takeout pasta and ate in the hotel and relaxed the rest of the night.\n\nThe marathon started at 8:10AM so I didn't have to get up until 6:30 since it was only a 5 minute walk from my hotel to the start. After I got dressed I walked over while having a bottle of water mixed with Tailwind which is my normal pre-run routine. Did a bit of warm up then jumped into the corral. Being me I was moderately confused by the corral being split up by paces instead of finish times. I eventually figured it out and started just in front of the 10:00 sign.\n\n### Race\nHead out from the start and hit our first traffic circle probably 25+ spread throughout the course. I, like usual, was a little quick at first but by around a half mile had settle down to my pace.\n\nThe course is fairly flat, my Garmin says just over 500ft of elevation change, and the first 4 or so miles are a gradual downhill. I cruised through those at just under 9:50 per mile. Including walking through the aid stations which I always do.\n\nMile 5 is pretty flat then 6 + 7 area slight uphill, still holding at around 9:50 miles. Mile 8 has a few kind of steep short hills and I pushed a bit too hard up the last one. In my defense there were people in Dinosaur costumes on the hill! Mile 8 was still on pace but 9 was just over 10:00 while I recovered from the hill.\n\nMiles 10 and 11 were back on pace at around 9:55. Mile 12 I finally found a porta that didn't have a line so made a quick stop so that mile was slow. Mile 13 and 14 bring us back through the start finish area to head out on another loop. This is different than the first loop so the course is kind of a distorted figure 8. From 13 - 16 I was back to my 9:50(ish) pace.\n\nPart way through mile 17 my legs started feeling a little heavy and I finished it in just under 10:00. Miles 18 - 21 I was starting to get tired and those miles slowed to the 10:20s and 10:30s. By the end of mile 21 I realized that sub 4:20 wasn't happening.\n\nMiles 22 - 24 each got slower than the last. 23 and 24 were both over 11:00. I had to remind myself at that point that even though 4:20 was over I could almost walk the last 2 miles and still get a PR. I managed to pick it up for miles 25 and 26 to get back under 11:00. By now I just wanted it to be over. I was able find a little bit more and finished in a chip time of 4:26:43. A PR of 20 minute over the 4:46 I finished CIM with last Dec.\n\n### Post-race\nPost race, after getting my medal and some water, I lined up to ring the PR bell and get a picture. Stopped by the pancake tent after that because I just ran 26 miles and I deserved some pancakes (no matter what my Dr. says)! Once I thought I'd be able to stand up again I headed back to the hotel for more water and a long shower.\n\nI have a 10k in 3 weeks so now time to recover for that. Then plan out my training for Chicago in Oct.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

I was not consistent but that was not the initial goal - I just enjoyed it in addition to the other sports I regularly did (pilates, HIIT, cycling, yoga). Due to over-confidence I signed up for the half marathon in November and then realised I was committed to not just running, but learning how to run better. Figuring out what a 5k pace meant, what speed interval training was, and more. I ran 2x a week (mostly easy runs) until mid-november and then took a break until January as I was not convinced by the cold, nor had yet invested in the gear. In january I found a running buddy and started doing 1x week long run (10k-15k), and then 1-2x week easy runs. In February I was traveling the whole month in central america and did not train, but I did hike ca 160km at various elevations over between 2.000-3.500m, so I considered this supportive of my training. Back in March I raced to get ready, running 3x a week (in addition to pilates and cycling) - again with 1x long run and 1-2x speed intervals and 1x easy run.\n\nIn March I also got new/proper running shoes (Hoka Clifton 9) and bought gels to integrate into training (but never tried them.. whoopsies).\n\nI wanted to approach my first half as more of an experiment and with curiosity to learn rather than as something I needed to perfect and conquer (as I did not know what to expect!). With that I set my goal to finish in 2:20 - which based on my research felt ambitious for a new runner.  \n### Pre-race\n\nAs I am based in Berlin I did not have to travel. I focused on my nutrition the week before, making sure to eat lots of healthy carbs, bountiful veggies and stay hydrated. I did not work out or run the week before as I was on my period and out of energy (which was frustrating and disappointing), but I went on longer walks to stay active. The night before I had a huge bowl of ragu and some sports drinks and headed to bed early so I could rest.\n\n  \n### Race\n\nThe race was so exciting! I was nervous, especially as I was running alone - but I was impressed with the organisation and kindness of all the staff. It was also impressive to see the diversity of all the participants and also a bit intimidating to see all those who appeared more seasoned and professional. I just reminded myself though this was an experiment and the goal was to have fun and see what my body and mind could do when pushed!\n\nI tried to start slow, reminding myself I had a long way to go. I felt great until around km4 - thats when a blister started to develop (in a place I always get it!). It was distracting and painful but I was able to quiet my mind and retrain my focus to all the wonderful signs and cheerleaders at the race, that kept me smiling the whole 21 km!\n\nI took my first gel anxiously at km 8 (before I started to feel fatigued), hoping for a calm stomach (there were no issues). I also drank fluids at each station and grabbed gels and bananas when offered. I really noticed how they impacted my body and energy levels, as normally before those stations, I would start to cramp in the right side of my abdomen and after consuming something, the cramp would disappear and my fatigue evaporate.\n\nThings were going super smoothly throughout (I was on time for 2:20 with buffer), with my goal being to never stop moving. That was until the space between km 18 and 19. There I was greeted by one of my best friends cheering me on - which completely overwhelmed me with love and gratitude. I was crying as I ran (keep in mind, I was still on my period), and tripped over myself, falling onto my knees and spraining my ankle. Shocked, I gave myself no time to think about it or feel the pain and got up immediately and then kept going as I was not going to give up so close to the finish line. I was in pain (and questioning the intelligence behind this decision), but not long after more friends (and strangers who read your name) were cheering me on which gave me the push I needed to finish. I picked up the pace and when I turned the corner and saw the brandenburger tor appear, I started to cry again 😅 and sprint, because I was so close!\n\nI crossed the finish line so proud and happy of myself and in quite a bit of pain. Grateful to my body for making it! Cue more crying 🙃 (I really underestimated how emotional it would be!).\n\n  \n### Post-race\n\n  \nHad water, an alcohol free beer and banana then met my friends. Felt physically great and still able to run (apart from the ankle, which bummed me out). Grabbed burgers and then spent the day hobbling around and celebrating this achievement! Spent the monday at the hospital getting my ankle checked out. Good news, it seems to be a sprain only and I have been fitted with a brace and will most likely be cleared to run again in 4-6 weeks.  \nI wanted to share my race here to encourage others who have just started running to go for the half and because I finally had a race I could share! This community has really helped me along the way as I learn the ins and outs of running and has been a source of inspiration.\n\nI am very much looking forward to the next half (goal is sub 2 hours) and eventually full - where I will invest even more into training now that I am hooked on the feeling :)\n\nP.S. If you have advice on pervasive blisters (especially on the pad of your foot below the base of the big toe), I would be grateful as nothing has worked."

I didn't follow an exceptionally structured trainig plan, but aimed to hit 120km each week in the build up which I did. I knew going into this race that it would be quite hilly (275m of elevation gain), so hill reps of varying lengths and intensities were an incredibly important part of my training. I raced sparingly in the build up, with a 1:18 HM in January after the first few weeks of training, and then a 1:16 HM a couple of weeks out, serving as the final hard effort before the race. This allowed to me maintain high mileage without having to taper frequently. Some of the biggest workouts I did in the final weeks in the lead up to the race were 24\\*400m at 75 seconds avg with 60 seconds static/walk recovery, or long runs on back to back days, like two 30k days back to back days which set me up with real confidence that I could excel on tired legs. An example of this was a 30k run with two 5k steady portions at 4:05 per km, and then the next day doing a 30k run with 4\\*4k at 3:50 down to 3:35 per km. I made sure to take a couple of days very easy after that particular weekend to recover as much as possible. Once a week at the very least, I would train at the track with my local athletics club, which kept a lot of speed in my legs through out the whole process. I was feeling super fit coming into the marathon, especially having run 1:16 in the build up. I Dnf'D at my first attempt of the marathon in October last year due to a toilet related emergency so I was determined for this to go differently.   \n\n\nPre-race\n\nI stayed about 30 mins from the race start, once I got there, I dropped my bag off and had a couple of electrolyte tabs as the sun was coming out at that point and I wanted to get ahead of it. I had two 90g Precision Fuel and Hydration gels and one 30g one in my Salomon running belt (highly recommend both the belt and gels!). As we got closer to the start, I met some of my friends for a quick pre race chat, and just tried to quell any pre race nerves. By this point, the sun had really come out and the wind was picking up, two things you definitely do not want on a coastal marathon. As we got near the start line, I tried to shuffle a bit closer to the front as my goal time would put be top 50 previous years. At the start line, I noticed the starter was Paula Radcliffe, a bit of an ominous sign considering what happened last time, and suddenly the countdown was on. The six seconds before I crossed the start line after the horn went off felt like eternity.   \nRace\n\nAnd away we go! The first 400m were flat, before the first big hill of the race, which many people bombed up without a care in the world. I latched on, but just keeping a bit quicker than goal effort so I didn't get trapped in no mans land. After another 400m, we turned a corner and began the descent down into the town centre. This is where people really (stupidly) started picking up the pace, and a few people moved past me and the group behind. The atmosphere was electric. We just locked in and cruised till 12k, when the race started hitting rolling hills out a long the coast. From this point onwards, only one person passed us and stayed ahead for the rest of the race. I just kept telling myself to trust the process and we would start moving up from the mid thirties position wise. 12-25k was brutal. Unrelenting hills, wind, and sun  were ongoing and I could tell it was taking a toll on people who had gone out hard. Me and a mid-race friend shared windbreak/pacing duties from 12 through 25k where the course began to level out on the sea front. Still, the wind and sun did not relent. The one thing that stuck in my mind was to get nutrition in before I desperately needed it,  so from half way to 25k, I got through 90g of gels, and made sure to take time to swallow each one without distress. At every water station, I was throwing water over myself just to try and cool myself down in the heat, but I still felt like I was overheating.\n\n At 30k, I allowed the pace to slow a little bit, knowing I had banked a bit of time earlier on, and I really didn't know how that last 10k would feel as the most I've ever raced is a half, and only 32k before this training block. At 32k, the route wove through residential areas and the support was amazing. At this point, I was passing a lot of people, and still feeling good. I just told  myself to let the km tick by and not worry too much. At the 22 mile water station, I took two bottle of water, dumped one over myself and started sipping the other. At 36 ish k, there was a runner on the course who looked like they were seriously going through it. As we drew level, I offered him the remains of my water and he genuinely seemed over the moon. I kept pushing on, determined to reach the finish in one piece, without collapsing. At the 24 mile water station, I took another water bottle and readied myself for a slog. At 40k, the route turned onto the beach promenade, and from then I just told myself \"5 more laps of the track\". I kept pushing forwards, picking up the pace. 1k to go. Here we go. The crowds on the final stretch were right up against the route, and the path narrowed to maybe 3m across. I raised my arms to increase the noise and just drank it all in as I summoned the last bit of pace in my legs, and stormed across the finish line.   \nPost-race  \nAfter collecting my medal and t shirt, I laid on the grass for a little bit just drinking it all in, that I had actually done it. I felt slightly sick, which looking back was likely connected to the heat. I changed shoes and began hobbling my way back to the train station. On the train on the way back, as the Strava kudos flooded in, I checked the results. 17th? SEVENTEENTH? out of 13000? Decent days work that. Over the summer, I want to focus on racing on the track, and I might try to hit the London Marathon championship standard in the Autumn, if all goes well. \n\nBut for now, a bit of rest, and back to the drawing board. Thanks for reading.   \nMade with a new race report generator created by /u/herumph."

I started running in August of 2021 specifically to do a marathon, crossed the finish line that December and since then my addiction has been on par with having a meth habit. I’ve now run 4 marathons, 2 50k, 3 70.3s as I transitioned to triathlon and my crowning accomplishment last year was finishing Ironman in November. No question that even when I was full into triathlon, my first love was running. I’m pretty good on the bike, I’m no longer a drowning hazard on the swim, but the run workouts were my favorite. On top of that, early last year I had tried a 50k and absolutely fell in love with trail running, so giving up trail for all roads in my path to ironman was a sacrifice. This year, my goals were all ultramarathon focused. My “A” races were Miwok 100k in May, and then doing a backyard ultra (the kind where you do a 4 mile loop every hour until you give up) with a goal of 100 miles. I did my second 50k in February and my coach thought that doing this 50 miler would be a good test for the 100k next month and good psychological boost, so a bit last minute we changed the workout plan and got ready for this 50 miler which is on roads and trails I train on all the time. Leading up to race day I’ve been stressed, because I’ve never run this long and because it’s tax season I haven’t had as much training on hills as I’d have liked. Also, this season has been extra busy because my firm has grown so much (which is a great problem to have), but I was looking at this as a mini vacation. My family will be crewing for me, I have a superstar pacer to take me from mile 30 to 40 and my sister-in-law to take me from 40 to the finish. Just need to stay positive, enjoy the day, run my own pace and all should be good. \n\n\r  \n**Race Day:**\r  \nI wake up at 4:30 start getting everything ready. I eat my breakfast, getting my vest all packed up, all is normal. The one thing that isn’t normal, is that I’m taping all my toes for this race. I’ve been having trouble with blisters on my right pinky toe when runs are longer than 20 miles and my feet get wet, and taping that toe has seemed to help since the last 50k. I figure taping all my toes is a good idea just as that extra protection for a much longer race than I’ve ever done. All this to say I broke rule number 1: don’t do anything new on race day. I’m an idiot. With all the tape and my sock on, I put my feet in my shoes and they feel a bit tight. Nothing uncomfortable, just different, nothing to worry about I tell myself. \n\n\r  \n**Course:**\r  \nGreat course, starting in Folsom, looping around one way before going down and around Lake Natoma and then up north along Folsom Lake into Auburn where it finishes with a pretty brutal 2.5 miles or so of climb to the finish line. Weather was in the high 40s in the morning and no more than 62 or so all day, couldn’t ask for better.\n\n\r  \n**Race:**\r  \nAt the start line I meet up with my buddy Dustin who is always faster than me. He told me at packet pickup the day before that he’s gonna hang out with me, but I’m sure at some point he’ll take off. It’s 6am and everyone has their headlamps on and we start up a road uphill. I’ve heard from a ton of people before this race that it’s very easy to go fast in the first 15 miles or so and that I’ll need to resist that urge. Everyone starts jogging up this hill and about halfway up, I decide it’s just a little too much effort 2 minutes into the race and walk. Dustin keeps jogging, but because it’s dark I don’t see where he is. This gap is amplified once the course turns into single track a quarter mile later and it’s basically a walking traffic jam as people spread out. Nothing to worry about, I run these trails all the time and ultra runners are easily the friendliest community in fitness, plenty of people to talk to, I’m feeling good, taking things slow, super easy effort. Relatively uneventful first little 7 mile loop back to the start and the first aid station other than some panic I was having GI issues which were fortunately solved after a quick pitstop, and a fellow racer stopping at a little creek crossing and pointing out stable rocks to a group of us. I have named him Creek Crossing Batman in my head. Thank you sir, not having my feet wet that early was a big boost. I also did spend a little energy putting some distance between me and a racer I overheard talking about not being sure how long he was gong to go in this race. He was nice in talking to him, and nothing personal in it, just had no intentions of hearing anything but finish at all costs today. \n\n\r  \nAt mile 7 this turns into a road course for a bit. We’re on bike trails around Lake Natoma which I do a ton of when I’m training for CIM. The coach of my CIM training group surprises me by hanging out at mile 7 and running with me for 5 miles or so. She’s the one who inspired me to do ironman, and she’s an absolute badass. She doesn’t have “fun” races though, she is all competition. Usually when I run with her it means my personal coach is going to have some words because I go too hard on those runs. I have to very specifically slow her down and walk a hill or two, but she’s super fun to run with and by the time she drops off at mile 12 or so, I’m in pretty good spirits and feeling fresh. The one thing is that I do feel some pain in my toes. Not the usual right pinky, which I think is a bit strange, but I tell myself it’s no big deal and [enjoy the beautiful day](https://imgur.com/lQO0pPv).\n\n\r  \nI see some people in road shoes at this point and wonder if I’ve made a mistake by wearing my trail shoes. I see them 5 miles later or so as we enter some good hill sections and back on to trails and they are audibly lamenting their choices. Once we’re back on trails they’re actually some that I haven’t run on at all, so not only is it a gorgeous day, but I feel like I’ve found some new great trails to run on later, I’m having an absolute blast. I even send out a few memes on my group text ([including joking I got lost at mile 21, which did in fact happen at Ironman](https://imgur.com/emAsEY1)). Feet are starting to hurt a bit, but it’s early days, suck it up buttercup. I’m comfortable being uncomfortable. At mile 27.4 I get to see my family and pick up my first pacer. [I get to run with my kids a little bit](https://imgur.com/Y7Rhnq9), I sit down and they have a change of socks and shoes for me. I slip on the new socks and getting my feet into the new shoes feels like agony, something isn’t right with my toes. I do not let this on to my family at this point, and more importantly the longer I sit in this chair the harder it’s going to be to get up, so I’m on my feet quickly. Little bit of pain in my quads from the hills, so I throw some biofreeze on. Load up on carb mixes and gels and we’re off again with my first pacer.\n\n\r  \nMy pacer, Roman, is an absolute animal. He’s done Tahoe 200, Moab and he won the local backyard ultra that I want to do later this year with 140 miles or so. When he asked if I wanted him to be my pacer it might as well have been Lebron asking if I want to shoot some hoops with him. Uh… yes… yes I do. I’ve never run with him before, but we have a blast talking about races, about running, triathlon and the benefits of just being able to pee on yourself on the bike. Miles are flying by, and I don’t even notice as we pass 32 miles which is my longest run ever. Even the section of the trail aptly named “meat grinder” goes by quickly because of our conversation and his constant positivity. We pass a lot of people on this stint, some of which are in pretty clear pain, but I’m not giving in to mine yet. Though I’m noticing that I’m trying to keep my toes as still as possible, if I hit a rock or move them much it hurts a lot. Mile 39 I trip and fall and I feel some muscles in my hip tense up, but same as the chair, if I sit here it’s just gonna get harder to stand up. Shake it off ironman, or are you a pretender that did the easiest ironman course? I’m up quickly and back at it down into the canyon for the aid station at mile 40.\r  \n\n\nAt mile 40 I say goodbye to Roman, who by the way ran to meet me to pace me, then ran on ahead of me on the course to go home. Animal. I see my family and pick up my sister-in-law who is going to pace me for the rest of the race. This is extra special to me because she’s the reason I started running in the first place. She’s qualified for Boston multiple times and her course record here is 10:57 or something and I’ve been telling her I’m going for 10:55 and she will jokingly remind me that I have to think about the 100k next month. Honestly I’m surprised by how good I’m feeling at this point. My feet hurt like hell, but I’m not tired, and I don’t feel fatigue until mile 42 or so. Miles keep flying by and Elisa and I are having a good time. I’m walking up any hills and jogging on any flats and downhills. I’m not sure when, but the walk breaks start getting a little longer after the crest of hills and by the time we reach the final 1000 feet of climbing and 3 miles there aren’t a lot of runs left in me. I know I’m not going to beat her time, and I also know I can pretty much walk the rest and beat my ironman time (don’t ask why that’s important, it just felt like it in the moment). So we start the steady trudge up the hill and the pain in my quads is a welcome relief from the pain in my toes. We get to the last aid station. 2.5 miles left and it’s all uphill. I grab a popsicle and I just focus on enjoying the walk. There have been some people that passed us a bit ago, but I’m slow up hills to begin with and there’s no one up or back for a long way, there’s no reason to push. I’m extra proud of this part. At ironman after missing a turn my mind went dark, I finished the race mad and I wish I would have enjoyed it more. Here I’m taking in the views, I’m enjoying talking with my sister-in-law and completely ignoring the pain in my feet. We do see one guy coming up near the end, I put in some effort to not get passed one more time, so my competitive spirit isn’t gone completely. We crest the final hill, I see my family, [I take my daughters hand and we run across the finish line together](https://imgur.com/zFCeME3). There was no sprint, no yell, there’s no wave of relief, just peace, just calm. That’s a good day.\n\n\r  \n**Post-race:**\r  \nI take off my shoes, and my toes feel surprisingly good. They’re all taped up, and I have no interest in taking that tape off, because whatever injury is under there doesn’t exist if I can’t see it. I finally do after I’m home and I’m showered. 3 toes are black from blood blisters, I have 2 or 3 regular blisters in various places. I’m going to lose at least 3 toenails when all is said and done. I’m 95% sure I’m not doing Miwok next month because it’s probably going to be 2 or 3 weeks before I can run again. That said, I’m not sure I can top that day. I like to think I’m mentally tough, but since nearly breaking at Ironman I’ve had my doubts. This felt like redemption for taking races too seriously. This felt like my magnum opus of mind over miles. \n\n\r  \nI’ve been constantly looking for longer and longer races and setting goals higher and higher, waffling between triathlon and ultras and unsure about my race calendar later this year, but after this one I don’t feel like I have anything left to prove. This will not be my last ultra, but if it was I’d be happy with it. Not bad for the guy 2.5 years ago who needed 2 walk breaks on his 15 minute treadmill jog. Not bad at all.\r  \n"

I started running again at 27 and did so casually without any training programs on and off for about a decade.  Now in my late 30s, I've been working on being more purposeful with my running.  I got more serious about it last year, but still lacked good training form and would get injuries more often than I should (turns out all Zone 4+ training is bad, who woulda thought?).  In August I got a Garmin watch and have been using its suggestions and training plans to better mix up my workouts.  It was an adjustment to learn to run mostly slower, but the results have shown clear improvement in every metric and I am not getting injured like I was before.  So I've been running for a bit, but more seriously and purposeful for about the past 8 months.\n\n### Training\nI've been training for a marathon that I have in June, which will be my first marathon.  I really kicked off proper training starting in Jan this year, and have been using the Garmin half marathon training program with some modifications to lengthen the distance of most of the runs.  The 13 week program ended this weekend, so I picked a local race to do that was roughly around the half marathon distance.\n\nMy training was set to a goal of a 1:36 half marathon, or about a 7:19 pace.  When I started the program, that felt like it was going to be tough to achieve.  I did 4 workouts per week, generally 1-2 easy runs, 1 long distance run, and 1-2 more intense interval or race pace-ish runs.  Since late Jan I've also tried to do at least one run between 13-21 miles per week, averaging about 16 miles.  For easy runs, I try to keep pace between 8:15-8:45.  On the long runs I try to do the same, but sometimes go into the 7:50s for some.  I also rotate which shoes I wear based on the type of run and feel like it's been good for balancing work across different muscles.  My neighborhood has a ton of hills (Seattle is like that), so I'm able to get in a good amount of hill work on my runs, averaging about 10,000ft of gain over 4 week periods.  I also occasionally switch to a trail run since it's fun, works muscles a bit differently, and it's something that would be criminal not to leverage when living in the PNW.\n\n### Pre-race\nI'm used to mostly running at night (9pm-12am) with some afternoon runs (long runs, trail runs, and some weekend runs), so the switch to the morning was rough for me at first.  My diet is a bit lower in carbs and higher in meat than average.  Throughout my training, I always felt like I ran best the day after a large meal of mostly protein.  So I had 2 large burgers (no buns) the night before the race.  I got way too little sleep and only slept for about 4.5 hours or so.  In the morning, I had a coffee, used the bathroom, and then had a half packet of tailwind with some water and a Kate's Real Bar for some carbs and food.  My wife and daughter then dropped me off at the race, which was only about 15 min from home.  I had them drop me off a couple blocks away so I could jog a bit on the way there.  \n\nOnce at the start, I met up with a friend who was also running, chatted for a bit, then headed to the front of the start since I felt I could do pretty well given the times in last year's results.\n\n### Race\n*start*\n\n\nThere was the countdown to the start and I could feel the anticipation beginning to peak.  Once the time went off, I jumped out of the gate and tried to keep pace with everyone at the start.  In the back of my head I was remembering that it was foolish to go fast at the beginning, especially since this race had both 10k and 10M runners starting at the same time, but my inexperience with races proved too strong.  About a quarter mile in, I realized I was doing a 6:20 pace with my heart rate already in the 160s, so I took it back a bit.\n\n*1-2 Miles*\n\nMy goal was to keep my heart rate at a reasonable level during this part, and not overdo it since the majority of the climbing was in the first couple of miles.  I knew that my goal pace was between 6:50-7:00, so I tried to keep there or just under.  Overall this was a good start, but I think more experience in races will help me get better about knowing when to pace with people and when to pass them.  I was somewhat stuck behind two runners here and I think I would have run a bit better if I passed them.\n\nThe really frustrating part about this segment, was that we were on the side of the road and the road had a massive camber, so my ankles were getting a bit stressed.  I found myself jumping between the road and the sidewalk to try to mix it up a bit.  Overall though, this was a good start with the only problem being that my heart rate got higher than I wanted and was peaking into the 170s.\n\n*3-4 miles*\n\nThis is the segment where finally broke out a bit from being behind those two runners and was approaching the south end of lake union.  This was a route I've run often, so I knew what to expect.  I felt good and was getting into a running groove here.  There wasn't anything too special about this segment except a bit of a downhill early and then some flat running. \n\nI ended up pacing with another runner who was a bit faster by the end of this segment.  As we turned from running south to running north, the wind shifted to being at our backs.  This was nice because it helped with running pace, but also not nice because I dressed a little bit too warmly and was starting to heat here by the end of the segment.  My heart rate was steadily creeping up and was above where I planned for it to be, so I was waiting for a bonk-type feeling.  However, I kept the pace up because I felt good and felt I could maintain.  It was a bit weird, the data was showing problems ahead, but my gut feeling was that I could continue like this.\n\n*5-6 miles*\n\nI was dealing with a bit of overheating during this time and was looking forward to the direction shift to heading west so I could get a bit more cooling effect from the wind.  I was still pacing with the person from the end of the last segment and it was a good cruising speed.  This was the segment where we finally split from the 10k runners and it was a good confidence booster to see most of the people ahead of me were on the shorter race.  This section was pretty much completely flat, so it was just a cruise.  However, this was the part of the run where it begins to feel like a slog and you're in that middle zone of running enough that you're getting tired, but also not close enough to the finish to get that sense of a boost.  The other issue here is that my watch was telling me I was clearly in Zone 5 and had been for a while now (later I realized it had my max heart rate set too low, so this was really zone 4).  By the end of this section, the person I was pacing with stopped to get water and I went ahead since I was wearing a hydration backpack.\n\n*7-8 miles*\n\nRight at the start of this segment, a couple of runners came up from behind me and passed me.  That naturally led me to up my pace a bit and keep up with them.  This was the section with a turnaround, so it was the first time you could see the runners ahead of you.  The people in the front were cruising and I clapped for them as they went past, which was fun.  I was happy to see that they weren't *that* far ahead of me.  I ran a bit farther to hit the turnaround and then began making my way back.  It was also nice to get a sense of how many people were behind me and where as I was passing people headed to the turnaround.  I passed my friend who I met up with here sooner than I expected and she was crushing it with her time.  I waved to her and gave her a cheer as she did the same to me. Heart rate began really creeping up during this segment and went into the 180s.  I was pretty sure it would all come crashing down based on the numbers, but for some reason I still had that gut feeling like I could keep going.  I felt like breathing, energy levels, and muscles all felt good enough to continue on at the pace.\n\n*9-10 miles*\n\nThe beginning of this segment is where we met back up with the 10k runners and had some more uphill.  I was still pacing with those two faster runners at this point and made the turn to start the small climbs which started the final push to the finish.  All that hill training paid off as the moderate incline felt just fine and I was able to maintain pace with ease.  My heart rate jumped into the upper 180s on the climb, but didn't feel like anything I couldn't handle.  When I got to the last bridge crossing I knew I was in the home stretch.  There was a gentile grade downhill to the final section to the finish and that was nice to bring the heart rate down a couple bpm while maintaining pace.  In retrospect, I wish I sprinted a bit more here and shaved some more time off.  \n\nAs the route approached the park, I'm getting ready to sprint the last segment for a strong finish.  To my surprise (and I should have looked at the map more closely), there was a final uphill climb for the 10 mile route.  It was only about a 60 foot climb, but it was a steep hill with switchbacks.  My heart rate peaked on this part at 190 and that truly felt like Zone 5 there, but before I knew it I was at the top, and then it was just a downhill to the finish.  I picked up the pace, sprinted ahead, and ran through the finish right as I saw the race clock hit 1:06.\n\nI smiled for the photographer, grabbed a finisher medal, and then slowed down to a jog, then a walk.  Huge smile on my face and couldn't believe that I was able to beat my goal not just by seconds, but by minutes. :)\n\n\n\n\n### Post-race\n\n\nI did some stretches, checked out the booths at the mini expo thing, and then had someone take my photo with the seattle skyline.  My friend then finished her race a few minutes after I did and I met up with her.  High fives, smiles, and chats about the run.  We then went to the finishing hill climb to cheer on her other friend who I met that day.  He then showed up a minute or two later and sprinted hard to the finish as we were cheering him on.  It was extra fun to have friends doing the run too.\n\nMy wife and daughter came back to the park around this time and we met up with them.  We then walked to a local restaurant for brunch and enjoyed some bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches with well-earned beers.  Nothing like a socially acceptable beer at 10am!  After brunch we left and went home, and I spent a good portion  remainder of the day resting on the couch.  I did a 20 minute Zone 1-2 recovery ride on Peloton before going to bed to make sure the muscles stayed a bit looser and didn't get too tight.  Seemed to work ok since I can walk today.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI was quite happy with this race as my first race experience in 7 or so years.  It was also the longest distance race I've done in my life, having only done 10k and below before.  I feel more confident about the marathon in June as a result of this.  The race crew did a great job and this seemed well run.\n\nOverall it was a blast and I'm looking forward to doing more races.  All I want to do today is go running again.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "I recently tried these 4 shoes from my local REI:\n\n* Brooks Glycerin 21\n* Brooks Ghost Max\n* ON CloudMonster 2\n* ON Cloud 5\n\nWould like to share my opinions. I walked, ran, bent feet, and jumped with each pair above in store. So my opinion would be brief, and nothing long term.  \nON Cloud 5: It's comfortable when standing still, provides this cloud-like feeling around my heels. But I feel the support it provides is limited when running and jumping, probably due to its thin and stiff sole.  \nON CloudMonster 2: Has a high sole. Provides even more of this cloud-like feeling like Cloud 5. Support wise, it feels like between Cloud 5 and Ghost Max. When I started running, I got one problem: The outer topline keeps rubbing against my skin, uncomfortable to a point that I think my feet would suffer from abrasion if I wear these for a long run. The design and shape of this shoe is not fitting my feet correctly. Not sure if this is a persona issue, or many other people would have the same problem too. Overall my least favorite. Just as a reference, I have slim petite feet. (Woman in size 6)  \nBrooks Ghost Max: After trying the two ON shoes. I instantly feel more comfortable after putting Ghost Max on. Soles are a lot softer, and the inside just feels like a soft weight blanket around my feet. I enjoyed Ghost Max a lot, until I started running. The heel of this shoe keeps slipping off, making it very annoying. I could not properly run in these. And again, I cannot tell if this is just me, or others would have the same problem. People with wider feet, especially wider heel might have a better luck.  \nBrooks Glycerin 21: Just like CloudMonster 2, the sole is higher. The softest and most comfortable among all 4 shoes. Whtn I put this pair on, I instantly feel the difference. The shape of the shoe fits my feet correctly. It provides support from all directions. Has the softest insole, provides most support when jumping & running. I could not pick out any major problems so far. My personal favorite among all 4 shoes.  \nOverall, ignoring all my personal problems & only focus on the properties of the shoes, I would rank the shoes as:  \nBrooks Glycerin 21 > Brooks Ghost Max > ON CloudMonster 2 > ON Cloud 5  \nAnd for me personally:  \nBrooks Glycerin 21 > ON Cloud 5 > Brooks Ghost Max = ON CloudMonster 2 (not wearable tier)  \nMy biggest suggestion: **Go to your local store and try out different shoes yourself. A pair of shoes might have a good reputation online, but until you tried them, you would never know if it works for you personally or not.** You can only spot all these tiny little problems when you run and jump in a pair of shoe yourself."

The plan was followed rather religiously (5 days of running + 2 rest days) until 3 weeks before the race when I was going home for 2 weeks. Two 12-hour flights and subsequent jet lag hit me hard, so essentially the last three weeks became elongated tapering weeks ([you can see](https://imgur.com/a/jdrQ82J) the weekly mileage dipped pretty drastically there) where I decided to take extra days off when training quality was low/the body needed more time to rest (FWIW I averaged 10hrs of sleep during race week...).\n\nOverall, RW's training plan is pretty decent, given the variety of intervals, speed, etc. although I wonder if more easy runs would be helpful (it's not exactly 80/20, I think?). In retrospect, I think the training mileage (although not VERY high) really gave me more confidence on the race day even though in the week leading up to it, all my runs felt like shit.\n\n## Pre-race\n\nI started carb-loading (really just trying out all the nice Italian restaurants nearby) during the week. The night before I had a Maurten 320 and in the morning, a 160 + two sachets of oats I've practiced in the previous weeks. It obviously worked (almost feeling like an overkill for HM, no?), but one thing I failed to consider, which *almost* came back to bite me, was how much liquid I consumed... I used the bathroom twice before the pre-race warm-up & almost tempted to use it again during the race. The warm-up wasn't particularly helpful (that's what the first 2km is for), but I found my body surprisingly stopped shivering given how cold London was this morning (\\~5°C) and I was only wearing a singlet (which was a great choice as it got warmer).\n\n## Race\n\nP.S.: I now have a newfound appreciation for those detailed race reports (esp the actual race section) as I don't think I remembered much from the race other than I desperately tried to settle my breathing pattern into a rhythm & whoever was in front of me was getting in my way! Anyway, the [race course](https://fatmap.com/routeid/3185093/kew-gardens-half-marathon-2024/elevation-profile) is set up by a section in the Kew Gardens (\\~4 miles) and a return trip along the Thames River; this will be the structure I report.\n\nMiles 1–4 (Kew Gardens): Knowing I wasn't quite at 1:45 (well, how *wrong* was I), I started with the 1:50 group as I was going to gauge where I am around 10k and decided from there. So per usual, I started a little slower than my normal pace before I decided around mile 2 that I wanted to stay consistently & ever so slightly in front of the 1:50 pacers––if I got overpassed, I'd just rejoin them; if not, I will hold a steady pace until I felt the need to speed up. There I was, running out of the Kew Gardens, without even realizing it.\n\nMiles 5-9 (outbound): There was a section of narrow mud road, which I didn't appreciate (had to do small sprints to overtake people (including a random dude on a bike in a race that was just commuting??) in front of me. The pace had come to 5 min/km, and at this point I had stopped thinking about pacers, focusing on my own pace (and one of the girls next to me) and hoping I still had the legs for the final sprint.\n\nMiles 10-13.1 (inbound): just holding on to my dear life on my way back. Realizing I didn't really have the legs to up my pace even a tad bit (I was hoping I could do a 4:50, but my splits all ended up being consistently just below 5...). The funny thing that I just realized as I'm writing this is that I didn't get passed quite a lot, and nor did I pass a lot of other people.\n\nP.S.: A Maurten 100 CAF 20 min before the race started, and an SIS gel at 20, 45, and 1:15 in. \n\nP.P.S.: although this is not r/runningshoegeeks, my Endorphin Pro 4 did get a bit slippery when the ground was wet for those who care. Also Nike Aeroswift singlets FTW!\n\n## Post-race\n\nHad three bottles of water; an okay stretch on the lawn; and a cuppa hot chocolate, a pain au chocolat, and a gel (lol I packed five) right after the race. Favourite post-workout food has always been Nando's, and today is no exception. After this, I now have a 3-week trip where I decided not to run (don't want to bring an extra pair of shoes), Oxford 10k & Manchester HM in May (and, finally, Maine Marathon in Oct). This race definitely gave me a confidence boost & pretty decent time to work on for the next few months. Happy Easter everyone :)\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

Didn't think I would be sharing here so soon after [my last race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1bdmt94/i_ran_3_half_marathons_my_first_marathon_in_8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). After my training block I started my zone 2 training, but earlier this month after discussing with my friend about this race (and a bonus of a free T-shirt for early entries lol), I signed up for this race.\n\n**Racing Motivation & Goals**\n\nAs a NTU student for almost 6 years (undergraduate + masters 2nd year), I had actually never participated in this event since I only started taking running seriously last Jul, but since I'm nearly graduating from masters I thought I would participate it as my last chance to race as a student.\n\nAt first my goal was very simple, to beat my 5K PB (0:22:06 from 2024/03/03), which sounds possible to achieve since even Garmin was predicting I can run a 0:21:28. But a week before the race I looked up the race results from last year, and I found that to get into the top 20 you need to run at least 0:22:47. For the student division, for the top 100 you get a small gift, but for the top 20 you get a prize and a gift. So 5 days before the race I was motivated by this information, I added a goal to get into the top 20, or at least the top 100.\n\n**Preparation**\n\n2 weeks before the race I was still in my zone 2 training and running 50km per week, but the week leading up to the race I followed the Garmin suggested workouts for the race. I did base trainings, tempo run, and some sort of cadence drill a day before the race. Other than that, I had some easy runs with friends and 2 table tennis practices. In total I ran 39km and 7.5hrs of table tennis, but my legs were feeling fine.\n\n4 days before the race I ran the course with my friends just to try it out, but 2 days before the race I only just found out the course was changed a little bit from previous years. Even though it said it's a course around 5K, but from komoot's estimation it was closer to 5.8km (bruh), running within 0:22:47 seemed harder than before.\n\nAfter doing some research, I figured out a race plan: \n\n1. Run the 1st km 2\\~3s slower than goal pace, hold the next 3km, and then go all out at the end.\n2. As slow I can go to 4:12/km, but I would have to go all out at 3:56/km.\n3. By estimate, my 5K effort is around 186\\~190bpm, so... Hopefully.\n\nHaving prepared everything, I embraced my race day.\n\n**Race Day**\n\nRace day weather was not too ideal, it rained a lot before the race and it was more humid than cool, luckily I wasn't all wet (yet) before the race and I was 3 rows from the starting line when we were all waiting, I ate a pack of SIS before the race and wore my trusting racing shoes, and at 08:55 the race started.\n\n* 0\\~1km  \nImmediately I was running with the front of the crowd but by the time we were out of the track and onto the roads there were at least 100 people (or so I recalled) in front of me, so I got into work and got into my 5K effort quickly at 184bpm. By that time I completely forgot about my plan and I tried to pass as many people as I could without sprinting, and at 1km I looked down to see 4:05/km, and all I could think was \"Damn, I'm running fast!\"  \nThe funny thing about this split was I was feeling a mixture of excitement, nervousness, and fear. Fear is not something I had experienced from my past half or full marathons, and it made my breath-work a bit messed up, I guess it had to do with running with a massive goal or \"running something you know you can but you were afraid that you might mess up\"? Thankfully, I managed to refocused and got back to normal after the 1st split.\n* 1\\~3km  \nThis part of the race I was cruising like nobody's business, at every split I would look down to see how fast I was running, but seeing only around 50 people are in front of me now and on the turn-around seeing so many more people running behind me I just kept on going, my HR was high but I was still able to talk in short sentences.\n* 3\\~Finish  \nAnd then my body started to protest. In my mind I was still running at 4:10/km but my watch was telling me I was running at only 4:30/km, and it was hard to speed up from physical fatigue, my distance from the group in front was getting further and I wasn't happy with the pace but at that point no one was catching up to me so I wasn't as worried. My HR was spiking to 190bpm and I can only think mentally and not talk verbally. All I can think of is that I want this, I'm so close to finishing my goal, so I kept on going.  \nAt least, I was still thinking straight. I knew I have to start picking up the pace at 4.2km or else I would fall behind, and that's what I did. I mustered up what's left of me and got back to 4:10/km pace, my HR was passing 190bpm, I passed 3 more people before I got back to the track, the finish line was so close, 2 of the guys ran passed me, out of the corner of my eye I saw a 3rd catching up, at that last 100m I increased my cadence and crossed the finish line, I didn't know who crossed the finish line first, but I just knew it was over.\n\n**Post Race**\n\nFortunately my body was responding well after I crossed the finish line, I kept on walking and looked at the results. I broke my 5K PB by almost 2min, but unfortunately I was ranked 23, at least 7s from getting into the top 20. It was so close and yet I knew this is a result that I am happy with.\n\nI ran faster than I've planned at the start, and I sped up too early at the end of the race. These are things that I've done wrong and what I could learn from for my next race. I'm happy I didn't quit when it got hard, and I'm happy with my first 5K result.\n\nThank you for reading, and now it's time for me to get back to my zone 2 training!"

Having completed Paris-Brest-Paris (and some other multi day rides and races) and missed my main race of the year, I figured maybe this is the year to try some other stuff. I got decent shoes and slowly built up my distance, starting at just 3km. Learned the hard (runner's knee, shin splints) way that I need warmups and cool downs. Had to cut a lot of planned training, longest runs were two 16km runs, the last of which, 3 weeks out from the race, hurt my knee so bad it woke me up at night. Took the whole week off with lots of foam rolling, icing, and stretching, which seemed to work. Ended up doing two okay 12 and 14km runs in the two weeks before the race.\n\n### Pre-race\nI live 3km from the start. Had a light breakfast and got dressed, did some puzzles with my 3 year old (farm animals, South Pole, forest animals, all completed successfully), and got on my bike to the start. I could have walked but I figured cycling back after the race is a great way to get some blood flowing and start on recovery early. Arrived right on time but had to wait for 15 minutes before the race actually got started. My goal time was around 1:45 so I started behind the 1:50 pacers and figured I'd overtake a lot of people which would be good for motivation. That was dumb.\n\n### Race\nKm 1-5: Well my idea to start from the back sure was stupid. Had to wrestle myself past a lot of people since the principle of keeping the right hand side of the road free for passing runners was widely ignored. Ended up passing people on sidewalks and in the grass a lot. The audiences are enthusiastic, this is new to me, my bike races usually have no to little audience (either because of lasting several days of being offroad), only time I ever got cheered at was Paris-Brest-paris.\n\nKm 5-10: The plan was to get to 1:45 pace by halfway and that worked, my watch showed a 4:58 pace right around the 10km mark. Still feeling great. Not a fan of this part of the route, it's a newly upgraded (**cough** gentrified) part of town, surface is concrete and bad cobbles with lots of puddles.\n\nKm 10-15: Suddenly realize I forgot to eat my rice pudding pie at breakfast. Bummer but I don't feel glycogen depleted yet. Tried to grab isotonic drinks at the next few supply points and only realized that the cups are all the same, if you want iso drink you have to look for the people wearing ISO jackets. Had my homemade gel instead.\n\nKm 15-20: Into uncharted territory now, this is the longest I've ever run. I'm feeling perfectly fine though. Saving my breath because the one hill on the parcours is coming up. I like hills and pass dozens of people here, heart rate is at 174 which is fine, it drops back to 162 on the downhill so I really start picking up the pace now.\n\nKm 20-21: I realize I have been too conservative in my pacing. Doesn't matter, it's my first Half Marathon. I push a little more and average 4:30 until the finish.\n\n### Post-race\nFeeling surprisingly fine! I go for an easy 40km bike ride, a 5km recovery non-technical trail run, and do a kilometer of easy laps at the pool. I realize this actually counts as a triathlon but still refuse to piss on my bike. Next two races are the Antwerp 10 miles, and another Half Marathon on May 1st with my running buddy who didn't make it last Sunday because he got even more injured than I did.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

Half Marathon amongst a couple full marathons. The first two marathons got the best of me so I'm in the process of a longer training block for another go at it in June. I love the half marathon distance and had my last PR in 2022. I've been consistent with my distance running so I was anxious to see how it would translate to the shorter half marathon distance.\n\nGiven that I am in the first half of marathon training, and the plan is high volume with the premise of already running 10+ mile runs before I started 10 weeks ago, the distance for this race felt a lot shorter than it ever has for me when stepping to take on a half marathon. My training routine consisted of the following weekly schedule:\n\n* Monday: Rest\n* Tuesday: Easy Run (40-50 mins)\n* Wednesday: Speed workout within easy miles (45ish mins total)\n* Thursday: Easy Run/Steady Run (30-40 mins)\n* Friday: Rest\n* Saturday: Shorter Easy Run (\\~30 mins) with speed work/hills\n* Sunday: Long Run, sometimes with speed work filled in (beginning at 10 miles and working up to 20 miles a couple weeks ago)\n\nI was curious to see how my racing would respond for the half as I was not spending a whole lot of time running at my half marathon goal pace. At most I maybe ran 4-5 miles at my goal pace in one go during any of my training runs in the 10 weeks prior. It was committing to the 80/20 heart rate zone training and boy did it pay off. The human body is amazing with how it adapts and becomes more efficient while running at lower intensities! I definitely had to trust the training process to mentally get in the right spot to ensure I wasn't going to burn out early.\n\n**Pre-Race**\n\nGot to bed at a decent time and got around 5 hours of sleep or so the night before. We had a longer commute into the race at around 1:20, so we needed to get up around 4:00am. I'm a morning person and I was amped up so this was no problem for me; however here's where a huge shoutout to my wonderful wife who was coming along to support comes in :).\n\nI had some coffee to encourage a bathroom break before hitting the road, and ate a bagel with peanut butter to get some carbs in me to top off the tank. Most of my carb loading was spread out over the previous 48 hours and I don't like to run on a heavy stomach.\n\nWe got to the parking garage around an hour before start. The garage was a quick easy quarter mile walk from the start and there were no issues getting all ready to go and in position. It was a well organized start corral and not insanely crowded. I was able to use the bathroom and get all warmed up with some light jogging and make my way into the corral. As I was waiting I realized I felt pretty comfortable with my shorts and under armor long sleeve shirt that I had underneath a running tank. Given my experience running in the cold for my training, I knew this was probably not a good sign. I should be colder at the start of a harder effort like this to avoid sweating too much. I made a gametime decision and decided to ditch the long sleeve layer and just go with the running tank, shorts, compression calf sleeves and gloves. It felt somewhat crazy doing this at 35 degree weather at 7:30 in the morning, but skies were clear and the sun was peaking through the Philly skyline dawning on a packed corral full of half marathon hopefuls. I had a good feeling about it. Also, it gave me a mental edge of feeling like a bit of a crazy person. If was cold, all I had to do was run faster, right? Time to let it ride.\n\n**Race**\n\nThe proverbial gun goes off and the herd proceeds down the parkway. This race has one of the most scenic 4 mile starts of any I have done. The views are great and the sun shines through and off of the buildings in beautiful ways. The vibes were high and I was feeling great. My heart rate was staying low and my pace was bang on. I mentally had to hold myself back at the start. I've gone out too fast too many times. I was proud of how I was able to do that today.\n\nI got to see my wife and in-laws at mile 4 which gave me a solid boost as we headed away from the Philadelphia Art museum and North up the Schuylkill River. The crowds dissipated as we left the downtown area, and I was feeling great. I had some tightness in my left calf which led to some sleepiness in my left foot as I got a tingly sensation for a couple miles, but I knew that would shake out eventually, and otherwise I felt great! I continued to feel good throughout a majority of the race. I was pushing up the rare, but intense, uphill sections and my legs were recovering quickly following climbs. On the downhills I took advantage and let my big body fall down them to recapture some pace. The flats felt consistent and solid. All was going so well. Something had to give!\n\nWell something did give, and it was my right shoe lace. This was at mile 10 right before the largest climb of the race. Now on most days, no big deal. I would pick up some pace, take a quick stop, tie, and be on my way. However, today was special in that I didn't have much mobility in my fingers! even with gloves on, my hands were pretty cold and somewhat useless. I didn't have a lot of lace to play with, as I heel lock my laces and don't have a lot left to tie for the knot (primary reason it came untied to begin with). I felt like I needed to try and tie it, so I sprinted up for a bit to bank some time, and I stopped to give it a go. No luck. The bunny ears were not forming, there were no loopty-loos, just a frivolous fumbling of frozen fingers. Best I could do was pull them tight and tuck the lace-ends under the loop tie on the tongue of the shoe, hoping it would hold.\n\nI began my ascent up the post-mile 10 hill which was picking off a lot of runners. This was definitely the most challenging part of the race, and I had to do it with a flat tire. It seemed to hold pretty well and thankfully I didn't have to compensate too much with my running form for it to hold. I powered through to the top of the hill and legs recovered again at the flats. I was really proud of that climb and not letting the shoe impact me too much. Just press forward. The remaining miles were a majority downhill so I could let it fly. Coming into the last mile, I knew there was a steady uphill section, but my legs still felt good to give it a solid effort to end with a sprint finish, still meeting my A goal.\n\n**Post-Race Thoughts**\n\nSummary: Proud! I've been consistent with my training and had to overcome some challenges during the race. I was disciplined in my strategy and it all paid off. I got my post-race beer, had some brunch afterwards, and now I get to browse amazon for some longer shoe laces this afternoon. What a day! Excited to continue my training through to my marathon in June.\n\nThanks for reading!"

I hated running. I went on a running date one time around my college campus, and lets just say I cut the date short cause I was so winded.   \nAfter college, I kinda fell out of any real routine from 2015-2018 did crossfit for a couple years and then pandemic, picked up running to stay active with no clear directions or goals. I then did barry’s for about a year, which I think improved my cardio abilities. Then work got crazy and I stopped working out for the first half of 2023.   \nMid 2023, I decided I wanted to run a marathon as a way to have a goal and stay active. .   \n**Plan and Training**  \nI had about 3/4ths of a year to get ready. Los Angeles had this “Conquer LA challenge” that rewarded those with an additional medal for those who would complete the Santa Monica 10k, Rose Bowl Half Marathon, and then the LA Marathon. I decided that would be a great structured way to get ready.   \nPre-10k  \nI followed this two month training plan i found online, but didn’t really think about pacing strategy. It was fairly basic with a long run at the end of the week, 1-2 recovery runs and interval training one day. I completed the 10k with a time of 59:49 or a 9:38 pace.   \nPost - 10k  \nI was recommended the nike run marathon training plan so I just decided to stick with that as the 13 mi long run aligned with the weekend I would have to do the Rose Bowl Half  (2:14:24 at 10:16 pace). It was an 18 week plan so I had a couple months where I just maintained a 6 mi run route. I enjoyed the nike marathon plan in that they would introduce things like running in the rain, what to wear (nothin new on race day), fueling strategy, pace strategy, why we do tempo runs or intervals, incorporating intervals on long runs.. Great introduction to marathon training in my opinion and had enough variety to keep it interesting. (though i might try something else for miles recommendations for the next marathon, but would probably use the nike run app for voice guided runs when able).   \nThe longest long run was 20 miles, completed in 3:45 at 11:16 min / mi pace - so I was a bit worried about the 6 additional  miles I had never run. I do feel like if I had run that 6 miles before i might have been mentally better able prepared (but more on that later). Based on the half and my long runs, I did feel confident about under 5 hour goal, but unsure of the under 4:30 goal.   \n**Pre-race**  \nWoke up 3 am, ate my pre-race oatmeal and cup of coffee so I could poop.   \nLeft the house at 3:45 to take LA Metro A Line from Azuza to Union station where I took the 5 am shuttle to Dodger Stadium. (as an aside, I was a bit worried the train would be weird, but there were plenty of other marathoners on the train gladly)  \n5:15 fell in line at the porta potties and pooped again (thankfully since i figured 2 times is the charm)  \nI made my way to the open corrals and ran into a friend with a similar pace strategy 11 min/ mi. About 30 min prior to start, I debated going to the porta potty to pee, but decided to hang out with my friend and figure it out during the race.   \n**Race**   \nFueling Strategy: gu gels every 30-45 mins - towards the end I could really feel how helpful these were - albeit a bit cloyingly sweet.   \nHydration Strategy: water at every station and electrolyte every other. I probably could have doubled up the water on the front end. While I didn’t feel super dehydrated at the end of the run, I do think that I could have increased the water / electrolyte intake.   \nShoe: Nike Pegasus 40 - never ran in anything other than this line - might try something new\n\n **Miles 1-5:** The energy was amazing, it definitely helped that my friend was there who helped keep me in a talking pace. We had found the 4:50 pace group and kept up. There is a dtla hill, but i feel like i was still electric with the energy of the race. Then I really had to pee so I parted ways with my friend and waited the 5 mins to pee. \n\n **Miles 6-13:** This was pretty uneventful outside of taking in all the views of the city - echo park, hollywood. I thought i would “catch up” to the 4:50 pace group in this time too, which you can see in 6-7 paces. I hit another pace group and decided to slow down. I felt really good. \n\n**Miles 14-16:** There is nice downhill section. Breathing wise I was feeling good, but I was starting to feel the hint of muscle fatigue. \n\n**Miles 17-19:** The energy going in Century city the first time is amazing. I did not expect the crowds to be so amazing feeling. It definitely helped me get through these next couple of miles. My leg muscles were definitely feeling tight as I decided to walk though the 19 mi water station to get a slight break \n\n**Miles 20-22:**  Running away from the finish line - really impacted me mentally and physically, since there is an uphill portion going up sepulveda. The “wall” was there for me and I ended up walking a few times throughout here. Part of me was thinking -- you've never done this distance before, you can't do it. Looking back, it definitely was mental as theres a portion where you run under the freeway and past the VA hospital and theres no external motivation to get you through this section until you get into Brentwood. Funny enough I saw a runner that helped push me during the rose bowl half that got me motivated to run in this section. \n\n**Miles 23-24**: As I was walking between mile 22 and 23.  the 4:50 pace group caught up with me and it gave me the motivation to get back to run the final portion of the marathon. The pacer was amazing helping call out what to expect in the next section and giving motivation to the runners. He did call out to take advantage of the last hill descent as the last stretch was an uphill. At mile 24, I realized I had a little more energy to get ahead of the group. It was nice having a group of people to run with closer to the end.   \n**Miles 25-26.2**: The last uphill I actually felt relatively good. I was feeling sore, but the energy of the finish crowd kept me going. As I was coming up on the finish line, I saw time at 4:50 and I knew I could get under 5 and it gave me the last push to get a final time of 4:48!!!\n\n**Final Thoughts**  \nLooking back I did enjoy the whole process including the training. I probably will do another marathon as I do enjoy the timeline and would like to see if I could meet that 4:30 goal next year. It would be nice if it did end in Santa Monica for the 40 anniversary. Could always hope!   \nHope you enjoy reading this, I enjoyed reading the different race reports from year’s past so decided to contribute as well.   \n",

I had not run more than a mile before starting this training. Prior to training I was not in good shape and was struggling to keep my weight down. I had just finished reading this amazing book “How Bad Do You Want It” by Matt Fitzgerald. I was so inspired by the athletes and their mental fortitude to push past their limits that I wanted to push myself past mine. So I did some research, bought some running shoes and downloaded the Run With Hal app. I made it clear to myself that I had to hold myself accountable for this goal. So I paid the entry fee before I even started training. \n\nOnce I started training, I was doing roughly 25-30 MPW and that stayed pretty consistent throughout the whole program. I was learning to find my pace and rhythm after a month of training. I remember my first big run being about 3 weeks into training which was 12 miles and how I feared the thought of it. Sure enough, I was able to push through and felt confident going into the rest of my training sessions. I did struggle to keep up with my training schedule for a week or two but tried to make sure I was consistent overall. \n\n\nPre-Race\n\nI was following the Run With Hal apps planned routine. Running 25-30 miles a week up to race day. I felt great, had no injures and was excited for the marathon. The day before I prepared my body with 2 gallons of water, multiple packets of electrolytes and loaded up on carbs. I felt mentally and physically prepared. \n\nRace Day\n\nWoke up at 3:00am took a cold shower and arrived at Dodgers Stadium around 4:15am. Once I had gotten past the security check I found a nice seat on the floor and got into a meditative state of focus. I drank 2 bottles of water, ate 2 honey stinger waffles and a banana. As we approached the start time I stayed towards the back of the 13 min corral. I have the tendency to get claustrophobic especially stuck in a sea of people. \n\nAs the race started I felt great, but I wasn’t use to running with so many people. It was a bit tricky as I didn’t want to accidentally step on someone or god forbid accidental hurt someone. Moreover, I was able to cruise through the first 13 miles. No problems at all just soaking up every moment. I loved seeing the crowds of spectators cheering with their inspiring and hilarious signs. The spectators definitely gave me that much needed boost to push myself. As I continued through miles 14-19 I was going at a decent pace but I could feel the fatigue hitting. I was making sure to drink water and electrolytes at every station, while taking a GU every 45 min. \n\nAt the LA Marathon once you reach mile 20 you loop around for the last 6 miles which is fine. The only problem for me was running past the finish line and seeing the end of the race be so close yet so far away. Miles 20-23 I transitioned into a walking and running approach. Which was helpful till I started getting the most painful cramps in both of my thighs. Every step was painful but I had just read this beautiful sign a spectator was holding that said “Pain is temporary. Pride is forever”. I took that quote and quite literally ran with it to finish line. Leaving it all on the course.\n\n\nPost Race\n\nAs I crossed the finish line an unusual feeling of emotions took over. A racer next to me said “great job, I am so proud of you” and a flood of tears came rushing down my face and I couldn’t stop crying. I was a bit embarrassed and worked to pull myself back together. I was so happy to get my medal and was quick to grab a banana and water. I didn’t stay for the post race festivities as my partner sadly was stuck in horrible traffic and wasn’t able to find any parking. So I walked to a spot about 20 min from the venue where she was able to pick me up. We went and enjoyed a nice In-N -Out burger. Then I got home took a nap and we went and celebrated at a local pub with a green beer. \n\nI am extremely proud of myself and very thankful for this marathon. It taught me more about myself and my abilities I ever thought possible. This marathon also helped me get my life back on track, and I am forever grateful for that. Lastly, I want to give such a big shoutout to the supporters and their never ending cheering and constant encouragement. Along with those individuals who were handing out water, electrolytes, oranges, etc. not all hero’s wear capes! Thank you all so much. \n\n\nThank you all! I love reading these. They alway motivated me, when times got tough during training. I hope this might help whomever. "

My background revolved around basketball; I played it my entire life, and it was my main focus. Disliking running, I often took shortcuts in conditioning. I soon realized I lacked proper running technique (still do, lol).In June 2023, I embarked on my running journey- influenced by runners on TikTok (especially Matt Choi at the time), I became fascinated and immersed myself in learning about the sport. Starting mid-month, I logged 17 miles in June, 50 in July, and 70 in August. Attempting to incorporate speed work, I developed runner's knee. This took me months to work through with a PT- just a crazy amount of muscle imbalance. Taking it real slow, 1-2 runs a week. It wasn't until Oct/Nov that I was able to run pain-free but by then it was the holiday season so I couldn't run as much with all the obligations.\n\n### Training\nFast forward to February 2024, I find my rhythm again and can maintain a more consistent running schedule. Throughout my journey, my pace consistently hovered around 11-12 minutes per mile in for high zone 2. February became a pivotal month for me; I managed to log approximately 20 miles per week. Running 4-5 days a week, I learned how to safely incorporate speed work, added a few long runs on weekends, and saw my zone 2 pace improve from 11/12 minutes to 10/9:30 minutes per mile. However, three weeks before a planned race, I pushed too hard with two speed days in one week, resulting in a reaggravation of my patella. Previously, I had suffered from ITB issues, but this time, it was the hip flexor. It was frustrating to face another setback after putting in the work during February. Consequently, for the last three weeks leading up to the race, I limited my running to no more than two days per week to give my knee ample rest without sacrificing too much fitness.\n\n### Pre-race\nWhen I signed up, my goal was to achieve a sub-2:00 finish time. However, as my fitness improved throughout February, I set my sights on breaking the 1:50 mark. To prepare for the race, My last run of the week was Wednesday Run Club, which was a slightly muddy trail run with good elevation. I wanted to incorporate a shakeout run on Saturday but I skipped it instead to give my knee more rest. I carb-loaded with plenty of pasta and pizza on Friday and Saturday. On the morning of the race, I woke up with my knee pain rated at 6.5 out of 10. The plan was to take some ibuprofen, ease into the race, and hope my knee could withstand the pace for a sub-2:00 finish. Despite my usual 5 hours of sleep, I managed to get 8 hours of sleep the night before the race. For breakfast, I stuck to my usual combination of a bagel, banana, and honey, which I always have before any quality run. During the drive to the race, I drank 500ml of water mixed with Maurten Drink 160 and 1 packet of LMNT. The night before, I spent an excessive amount of time selecting my outfit and ended up choosing the only green top that I owned, which was a thermal Nike 1/4 zip. I didn't pack a second option just in case, and it turned out to be the right decision as the weather was cold and windy walking to the event. However, the temperature rose quickly, reaching 66F at the start of the race and climbing to 72F by the end and I learned my lesson on dressing appropriately.\n\n### Race\nAs they opened the gates for the half marathon runners, I took my pre-race caffeinated Maurten gel and planned on taking a gel every 30 minutes. I place myself between the 2-hour group and the 1:50 group. Skipping my shakeout run I thought I would have more anxiety while in the crowd, but oddly I didn't have any. This race was organized to let groups go at the start and wait for the next group to go. As we do this dance a few times I can still feel the irritation in my knees. I crossed the start line and started my watch, and my knee pain went away randomly. This is the first time I've ever run a race so it was so weird seeing all these people around me running for the same goal as me. I wanted to take a 5/5/5k approach for this race but this course had 500ft of gain, then a 350ft descend, then another 100ft of gain, and the last 2 miles -200ft so I decided to play it by feel.\n\nMiles 1-4.5\n\nThis was a flat 2 miles north and then 2.5 back. This is where I tested my knee's ability and let the pack kind of guide me into my flow. Unfortunately, for the first 2 miles, my left arch was getting a hot spot. I felt as if my left shoe was a bit too tight but I double-knotted and didn't make any time to adjust in pre-race. I told myself if it didn't go away by mile 4 I would stop and adjust. Luckily it went away around mile 3.5. Here in these miles, my pace was good, I felt like it was a little slow for sub 1:50 but knew I could make it up on the downhills.\n\nMiles 4.5-7\n\nHere is where our journey began, with a daunting ascent of 350ft. I dreaded this part of the course, as I hadn't trained much on hills at all. My daily runs consisted of a smooth 1-mile loop around my neighborhood. It wasn't until about a month before the race that I joined a running club and was obliged to tackle some hilly routes, albeit only once a week and often with my troublesome knee. Nevertheless, I managed to surpass my expectations here. Despite the incline, I didn't slow down much and I passed up a lot of runners that I kept in front of me as pacers. I maintained a steady effort, mindful of the next hill coming up as I saw on the other side of the course.\n\nMile 8\n\nAs I rounded the corner, I was met with a steep 180ft climb, the type of hill that begs for hill repeats. Having grabbed two cups of water at the previous water station, I felt prepared to tackle it. With a determined shout, I pushed my legs hard, propelling myself up the incline. It was a grueling effort, and I found myself passing many unfamiliar faces along the way, some of whom had chosen to walk portions of the hill. In my eagerness to spread positivity, I offered quick words of encouragement with a thumbs-up and a \"You got this!\" as I pressed on. Perhaps it came across oddly— the running community can be peculiar at times— but my intentions were sincere.\n\nMiles 9-11.5\n\nAs I completed mile 8, I sensed that I might have pushed too hard in the previous mile. Fortunately, a water station awaited me near the start of mile 9— a crucial refueling point for me. During these miles, which were mainly downhill, I made a conscious decision to pick up the pace if I had the energy to spare. Glancing at my watch, I noticed my pace dipping below 7:50 per mile, indicating that I was making up valuable time towards achieving my sub-1:50 goal.\n\nMile 11.5-12.25\n\nAs I maintained a pace below 8 minutes per mile, I felt confident in my pursuit of achieving my sub-1:50 goal. I had diligently studied the elevation chart on the race website, mentally preparing myself for the course. However, what awaited me next caught me off guard. After completing the downhill stretch and rounding the corner, I was met with a mile-long straight full of runners on a slight uphill. Although it was only about a 100-foot elevation gain, the cumulative effect of battling steep uphills and downhills took its toll. This particular mile will linger in my memory for as long as I continue running. I spoke with a few fellow runners after the race, and they shared my disbelief at the relentless succession of hills. I couldn't help but wonder, is this level of elevation normal for a course like this?\n\nMiles 12.25-13.1\n\nIn the last couple of miles, my goal was within reach. Glancing at the total time on my watch, I realized I had about 20 minutes left to achieve my goal. It was all downhill from here, swapped the playlist to Knock2, and started pumping the legs. As I entered the final mile, I spotted spectators offering homemade snacks. Feeling fatigued from pushing through the last stretch, I was desperate for water. Fortunately, I spotted a crucial water station after a tunnel. Although it wasn't set up for this side of the race, some kind souls crossed the street with cups, and I gratefully grabbed one almost dropping it. Big shout-out to whoever discovered the pinch and dink technique because you saved me. The water flowed into my system, the water rejuvenated me, and I felt fantastic as I tackled the last mile, which turned out to be my fastest of the race. As I approached the finish line, I exchanged fist bumps with fellow runners and soaked in the cheers of the crowd, even though my noise-canceling headphones were blasting. Crossing the finish line, I struck a pose for the cameraman. While I had always imagined that I would be overcome with gratitude and emotion at this moment, I was simply relieved that the battle was finally over.\n\n### Post-race\nAfter finishing the race, I heard my wife screaming my name from the other side of the gates. They were on the wrong side, so we awkwardly made our way through the crowd to reunite. As we reached the intersection, my 2.5-year-old daughter rushed over to me, giving me a big hug and congratulating me on my race. She was fascinated by the medal and immediately asked if she could wear it, so I happily obliged. Basking in my accomplishments with my family, we eventually headed to the beer garden. My wife forgot her ID, so I went in solo, grabbed a beer, and caught up with an old work friend who ran the 15k. We celebrated with pizza and more beer.\n\nThe day after the race, my legs felt slightly sore, but by the next day, I was feeling all types of soreness, especially in my lower half and knees, which had worsened a bit. I've decided to take the next two weeks off completely. I've already signed up for another half marathon that takes place three weeks after this race, so I'm hoping the two weeks of rest will be enough to allow me to run it casually, although probably not. Time will tell.\n\nI also entered the lottery for the 2024 NYC Marathon. If I'm chosen, I plan to give my body ample time to fully heal before starting base training in June and then diving into a full training block in July.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading about my race experience. Sorry if it's a bit all over the place—it's my first-ever race, and I'm extremely proud of how it went. I'm excited for my future as a runner!\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "Ever since september of 2023, side stitches have been plaguing my running journey. I generally stopped getting them after running for a while, but one time I was running downhill during a mountain run and I experienced a debilitating side stitch. Since then, up till now, I have been getting horrible side stitches, sometimes even when walking. It is always below my ribs. Every run I have been on has resulted in a side stitch. The moment I start running down a hill, the side stitch comes back. I have tried everything I have found on the internet, including:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Slow, deep belly breathing (seems to make it worse once it happens)\n\n\\-Stretching out upper body beforehand\n\n\\-Breathing patterns\n\n\\-Exhaling during a foot strike on the opposite side of the stitch\n\n\\-Eating nothing before running\n\n\\-Eating a little before the run\n\n\\-Drinking before running\n\n\\-Not drinking before running\n\n\\-Drinking a few hours before running and then not drinking before the run\n\n\\-Pressing on the stitch\n\n\\-Slowing my pace\n\n\\-Buying low impact running shoes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings that make the stitches more manageable for me have been slowing my pace, the new running shoes, and stretching. However when I do all of these I still get stitches.\n\nThis is putting my running journey in jeopardy. I went running today and felt amazing for a couple miles and then had to stop and walk home after getting a stitch.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips or help? I am desperate and willing to try anything."

However, I had a bout of plantar fasciitis that derailed by training from July to early September. I started to feel better about mid-September so I began training for the Richmond Half Marathon with a goal of sub-2. I was able to successfully gain mileage and maxed out my long run mileage at 11 before the race.\n\nStarting October 31st, I began my 18 week Marathon Training Plan. I used Higdon's Intermediate 1 Plan. The first week was four runs with a long run of 8 miles. During my second week, I ran the Richmond Half and ran 1:58. Afterwards, I started running five days a week with mid-week runs between 3-6 miles initially. I was able to adere to my plan and my total mileage for November was 100 miles, 141 miles in December and 150 miles in January and 113.3 miles in February.  I maxed out at 43 miles a week with a long run of 20 miles. I ran that distance twice. I did very well throughout the plan and there were only a few instances where I did not complete the scheduled run, including an 18 mile run, marathon pace 4 mile run and an 8 mile run.\n\nI also settled on the right shoes for this race. I wore Brooks Glycerin 21 and the amount of cushion made a lot of difference compared to the Brooks Avalanche that I used to wear. I honed my nutrition as well. For the 20 mile runs, I would use Maurten 320 in my two water bottles, Honey Stinger Gold and Honey Stinger gummies with caffeine at the midpoint of the race. I would also have some Sports Beans before running. I used my car as an aid station because I noticed I started to get thirsty with just Maurten 320. \n\nI would like to transition away from using Higdon's plan on Training Peaks because if my stretch goal was sub 4, I know I should not try to run 20 miles in my training run at that pace. For my next marathon, I would like to try Pfitzinger 18/55 instead. I also know that I need to increase my mileage to get sub-4 and I would like to do some speed work since Higdon Intermediate 1 only has tempo runs at Marathon Pace.\n\nPre-race\r  \nI picked up by bib on the Friday before the race. It was an easy in-and-out process. I got enough sleep Friday night and the nights before. I knew that I had to wake up at 3:45 AM on Race Day. On Saturday, I took my parents around, fueled with a lot of pasta,  bought my final nutrition, figured out the parking situation and was back at the house by around 6 PM. I laid out my outfit, my nutrition and pinned by bib to the shirt. I also picked out my favorite pair of running socks. I was alseep by 9:15 PM, and slept pretty well until I woke at 3:45 AM. For breakfast, I had Dave's Bread with Cashew Butter and a little bit of coffee. I also made sure I was hydrating. I was also definitely mindful of the bathooom situation and the location of porta-potties at the starting line. \n\nI arrived at the finish line a bit before 5:30 AM, and there was a school bus-shuttle to the start line. It took around 30 minutes to get there. Once there, I used the porta-potty immediately and warmed myself up on a bus. Closer to the start time, I checked my gear and shivered for a bit while I found the 4 hour pacer. Since the race only has a little over 500 marathon runners, they did not have staggered start times. I was crammed in with the 4 hour group and we set off at 7 AM.\n\n\r  \nRace\r  \n\n\nThe race itself started in Newport News Park, and it was a really beautiful morning. I ran with the 4 hour group and some of my running friends. I had the feeling that we were starting off a little fast, and their goal was to stay at 9:07 consistently. However, as my splits indicate in order to keep up, I was running sub 9s. It was not a problem initially but I eventually fell behind the pace group at the pace they were keeping. Overall, I felt really strong in the first half of the race. There was one hill/overpass that was not a problem. I walked through the aid stations and maintained pace. After the HM mark, the pacing group started to pull away even though I was running sub-9 minutes still. It was not until after Mile 18 that my legs started to feel sluggish and my quads were getting tighter. This made it harder to maintain the pace I had set throughout. I think if I had set my own pace rather than following the 4 hour pacer, I may have improved my time a good bit.\n\nOn mile 20, there was a slight hill which kind of made my legs cramp, and I found it harder to maintain my pace. I slowed to around a 10+ minute running pace to avoid walking. I also took a bit longer at the aid stations as I noticed I was getting really thirsty. Nonetheless, I was able to power through and finished fairly strong. \n\nThe course itself was absolutely gorgeous and took me through all the parts of the city. I work in Newport News so it was great to go through all the different neighborhoods and the final stretch really was a treat. The race was very well organized and folks were extremely kind.\n\n\rPost-race\r  \nI got through the finish line, and my parents were able to follow me from when I was approaching to the finish line itself. Richmond was jam-packed so this was welcome. At the finish line, I saw one of my friends I had been running and talking with since June. I immediately downed a Gatorade and a water, along with a granola bar, a bagel and a banana. \n\nAfter I met my parents, I kind of stumbled around and talked to my friends. I got a massage which was absolutely amazing and I can tell has helped my recovery a great bit. I picked up my gear, had tacos and two beers. All in all, a very nice post-race with wonderful weather. It was nice to run locally this time, and knowing the terrain and being able to sleep in my own bed made a huge difference. \n\nHighly recommend and a great race for a PR.\n\n\r  \n\rMade with a new race report generator created by /u/herumph.",

Started with a couch to 5k app (not actually C25K).  I always aimed to do a run/walk method as my knees are not great from decades of marching band and volleyball.  There was a lot of \"I can't do this,\" early on as I felt like I was dying after a mile with only ~5 minutes of actual running broken into 30 second bits, but alas if I'd actually listened to everyone telling me it was a slow patient grind I would've been better off, since now I'm like, \"Oh just 5 miles this Saturday nice and quick and easy!\"  Once I finished the 5k training I jumped into the RunDisney plans built by Jeff Galloway, at this point I was pretty solidly using a 6 minute run 2 minute walk interval that I eventually morphed into 7/2 or 8/2 depending on how I felt, what training I had after, etc.  During this block I had a foot injury and had to give up on barefoot running for \"real\" shoes as my training couldn't take any more risk.  I was out for 3 weeks, had only run 4.5 miles as my longest run, and came back to running the week of a 10k race.  Did two 30 minute days and nailed the 10k race, everything felt great and that shifted me into the RunDisney plan for Fairy Tale challenge (10k and Half).  This built miles every other week with back to back Sat/Sun runs to prep for the weekend of races.  Two weeks before the event I did a \"mock\" weekend where I ran 3/6/13, just below race distance to both avoid accomplishing my goal of doing the distance in training and not doing a half marathon before the actual half marathon.  With that my training was done and I headed to Disney.\n\n### Pre-race\nEvery race day was the same in terms of timing so this section covers all 3 pre-races.  We were in Disney the whole week before races, stayed with my family down there who live just off property.  Wake up at 2:45 am, make a coffee, get dressed and pack a plain bagel with cream cheese while the coffee cools.  Chug coffee and hit the road to EPCOT around 3:15 am.  Once in the parking lot we'd hang in the car until 4am, get out, get the bib on, go through security and then find a picnic bench to sit and eat my bagel around 4:30 am.  At 4:45 am I would head into my corral after a port-a-potty trip (usually during the national anthem, sorry America but my timing was key here for peeing).  The corral generally was working towards the start line around 5am and off the start line around 5:30 am.  The only difference between races was I added a bowl of cereal to the pre-leaving the house routine before the half marathon.\n\n### Race\n5k - Super fun \"race.\"  This event is untimed and is entirely contained to EPCOT.  Really cool run through the park and backstage areas, loads of cheering cast members, a bunch of characters for photos (I didn't stop for any as lines were huge), generally very congested but the event is not for time so it didn't matter too much.  I just ran/walked a 7/2 interval not going too hard and finished in 38:37.\n\n10k - This was the hardest race mentally because I knew that I needed to force myself to go slow and save some legs for Sunday.  Right off the line I started too fast, but reigned myself in before the first mile, stopped for a photo with Mulan to force a rest, and then settled into a 14 min/mile pace (2 minutes slower than my normal pace).  Another fun race with slightly less congestion overall since you spend a lot of time on the roads.  Main issue here was that I REALLY needed to pee around mile 3 but port-a-potty lines were long, knew I just had to make it to Hollywood Studios, which I did thankfully, but mentally the race was a bit of a blur due to this lol.  Running between Hollywood and Boardwalk/EPCOT was the biggest rough spot here as it's a VERY narrow path so lots of congestion, but since my goal was to be slow this helped a lot.  Boardwalk area is fun, lots of spectators due to the hotels with balconies, a lot of fun signs, \"Worst Parade Ever\" was my favorite.  I crossed the line with a 1:28, including the photo and bathroom stop, and felt great, happy with keeping the slower pace.\n\nHalf - This was the big one (no pun intended) as it was the first race distance I had not actually run yet (very close of course).  I was super stoked, felt REALLY good off the line with no muscle pain, no need to pee, etc.  The first 4 miles of this race are very soothing and calm.  It's dark, the roads are large so congestion spreads out, there are a few characters and DJ's and such but mostly it's just a quietish run on very well maintained Disney roads.  At mile 4 you cross the toll into Magic Kingdom parking lot (The TTC) and had a good laugh at the cast member who shouted, \"Everyone on foot doesn't need to stop and pay parking!\"  The run through the TTC feature the Japanese drummers from EPCOT and the first area for spectators before going back to a semi-quiet run to Magic Kingdom after the GOD AWFUL WATER BRIDGE TUNNEL HILL.  Magic Kingdom is easily the highlight of the run, that quiet morning run turns into ABSOLUTE CHAOS ENERGY as you run past huge crowds on main street, everything gets narrow and more congested but you pass halfway with a lot of characters and photographers and just a massive energy boost to bolster you.  It was awesome!\n   After leaving Magic Kingdom was then the worst part of the congestion as there was construction going on so it wasn't possible to duck into the grass to pass the walking groups that were 4-5 wide, this lasted about a mile before the first major overpass of the back half spread things out again (And spelled the end for at least 3 runners I saw).  You then run on the banked roads and wish you couldn't feel pain in your ankles/knees but it's unstoppable.  Around mile 10 is where the true worst part of the running happens, you're close to the end, EPCOT is in sight, it's nearly over just a measly 5k to go right?  Well yes but then there are THREE ENORMOUS OVERPASSES IN A ROW.  This is where I was able to truly realize how my training compared to my fellow runners because while it was tough, and I did slightly more walking uphill I did not have to stop at any of the medical tents after each overpass, the medical tents which were FAR more crowded than any of the previous ones.  After that is when you get the true race atmosphere, by the time I entered EPCOT it was around 8am so people were coming into the park, crowds were massive, I got to punch a \"Punch here to level up\" Mario mushroom sign that a young girl held out, and then it was just crossing the finish line, the absolute greatest feeling.  Official time was 3:05:01, watch time (which I paused for the 4 character photos and one bathroom break) was 2:49:18.  I would've liked to run a sub 2:45 but with the congestion on the course I'm happy with my time. \n\n### Post-race\nTo say the feeling of accomplishment was great is a massive understatement.  I don't even have words for how good it felt (mentally) to cross that half marathon finish line.  Physically I was in ok shape, I couldn't feel my left toes and my armpit area on both arms had bad chafing from my UV sleeves (that I'd thrown out at mile 11), but overall my training worked for sure.  I was very sore afterwards, but managed to shower, nap, and walk through Magic Kingdom for my picture in front of the castle with my medals.  Afterwards was a normal dinner and then going home on Monday, ankle and knee still a bit twinged from the banked roads but mostly ok and ready to hit my next training block to prep for my marathon in May. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

Most of my runs were a mix between zone 2 and zone 3 runs. Prior to training most weeks I usually run around 25-30 miles a week and decided to begin upping mileage from that by 10% each week. I missed a couple weeks due to injury on one of my ankles. I suffered a second injury a couple weeks ago during my peak week. My metatarsal area hurts. It happened after a tempo run. Did not realize how old my shoes were and I believe that’s what caused it. Haven’t had the time to recover fully and certain runs cause more pain. I ended up peaking at 52 miles a week. This was my second road marathon. First one was at 4:15. I ran a 1:42 half marathon back in November and that gave me the confidence to shoot for a 3:30 marathon.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nRace start was at 6:30 and i woke up 2 hours prior. I started my day with a coffee and bagel. Once I finished that I drank Maurtens 320. I tried this mix for the first time a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the high amount of sodium and carbs. I had no nerves the morning of the race. Pretty rare for me.\n\n# Race\n\nI live in Ojai which is where the race start was. I run the course 5-6 days a week so was very familiar with it. Morning was mid 40s which is ideal for me. I run hot so I ran in a singlet, 5 in inseam shorts, and endorphin elites. I also had a handheld filled with maurten 320. I switched this out halfway with water from a handoff with my wife. I also consumed gels every 30 minutes. I decided I would run with 3:30 pace group. At mile 1 I found myself slightly ahead of the pacer. He was giving a turn by turn and speaking about the hills. At the start I got a bit annoyed with a woman behind me. Every time the pacer spoke she would (under her breath) tell the pacer to shut up (i won't share what she was actually saying which was way worse). I was very close to saying something to her but decided to speed up instead and just avoid the situation. Around mile 7 the pacer caught up to me and then I found myself getting a little annoyed by him too LOL. Sorry if you see this pacer. It was a lot of talking and he began giving history lessons about the town which was a bit much. I sped up again to get away. Around mile 10 a girl sparked a conversation with me. Her goal was sub 3:20 and she had her paces written down. She wanted to negative split. This is when I realized sub 3:30 was possible. I figured if I at least have her in sight it will be in reach. Around mile 16 there was a downhill that KILLED my injured foot. I was hobbling downhill but kept my pace. I knew it was painful but I couldn’t care less. I wanted the goal time too badly. Around this time the girl passed me and I started to think I was falling behind. Around mile 20 I somehow found her behind me. We ran together the rest of the way. It was very helpful that I normally run what is miles 18-26 of the marathon course. I knew exactly where i was at all times and i think this helped me not bonk. At mile 24 I felt a hardcore twitch on my hamstring and thought “this is where it all falls apart”. At no point did it become painful but it was non-stop movement in my hamstring. Luckily an aid station appeared at mile 25. I downed tailwind and the twitch went away. I finished at a time of 3:26 and I couldn’t have been happier. All the work I put in paid off. My next race will be an almost identical course of Mountains 2 Beach marathon in April followed by an ultra marathon a couple weeks after.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI was shocked when I stopped my watch. I turned around and the girl i met was right behind me so we were able to celebrate together. I had told my wife and in laws to be at the finish line for what would've been a 3:30-3:40 finish and I ended up running at a pace that caused them to miss my finish. My foot is still injured. Before the marathon it would hurt if I upped my pace on a run. If i did a long run it would hurt to walk the following day. at the moment it hurts even when i'm not moving. It's not something that I think will prevent me from running but definitely from running \"fast\" in training. I'm very proud of myself at the moment. I started running 2 years ago. The ventura marathon was my first marathon last year and I ran a 4:15. Shaving off 50 minutes in a year seems crazy to me. I'm excited what the next 12 months hold for me. This is just the beginning.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph."

I bought new shoes in November and texted my friend, “Do I want to run a 1/2 marathon or am I just looking for an excuse to buy more shit?” The answer turned out to be both! I picked the Ventura Marathon because it wasn’t too far to travel, a good # of weeks away for training, it happened to fall on my birthday weekend, February meant it wouldn’t be too hot, it bills itself as “Just enough downhill” and looking at previous years’ results, seemed like a smaller race with lots of recreational runners so not too intense. Sounded tailor made for me!\n\nI started training in November, using a modified version of the Hal Higdon beginner plan. On the advice of a great coach, I just concentrated on gradually increasing the duration of my runs, in Zone 2. This was huge for me - I actually really enjoyed my runs and I didn’t worry about my pace or distance - I just “ran” until my HR got too high, walked til it went down, then picked up the pace again. My first run was on  11/12/23 for an hour, 4.08 miles and an average pace of 14’13”.\n\nI continued going to the gym 3x/week, focused on a lot of hip mobility, single-leg strength/stability work and that made a huge difference. I did 1 long run, 1 moderate run and 1 interval run a week.\n\nI gradually increased my duration/mileage and got much more in tune with how my pace correlated with my HR and effort, but again - just stayed focused on Zone 2 and keeping it easy.\n\nI was pretty proud of myself for how consistently I kept to my schedule, even over the holidays! So that was a big goal already accomplished. I had some work travel in the weeks before the race so that threw things off, but I tried not to stress out about it too much. I knew I’d be able to finish and I wasn’t shooting for a specific time.\n\n(This was also why I picked the 1/2 for a first race - I thought a 5 or 10k would feel like more pressure to train for a specific finish time, whereas the 1/2 would be more about just finishing. And not as crazy as a full marathon.)\n\n### Pre-race\nWe had such a fun weekend in Santa Barbara/Ojai/Ventura! I did some yoga, walked, tried to stay super hydrated and got to bed early on Saturday. I was a little nervous about the early start time, as historically my body just does not function as well in the mornings but honestly, was too lazy to get up early in the weeks leading up to the race to get used to running in the early AM.\n\n### Race\nI could not have asked for a better race experience. The course was beautiful and although narrow in spots, they staggered the waves well enough that it never felt bottle-necked. Although, side-eye to the guy who brought a double-stroller. Why, guy? Why? \n\nThe crowd was super nice, the weather was perfect, my playlist was fire - it was ideal!\n\nI felt amazing the entire time and tried to balance not going too hard (for me, haha) especially at the beginning with just going with it and feeling great. I just really *enjoyed* the entire race.\n\nI ran pretty consistent splits and felt like I still had a little left to finish the last  mile or so as strongly as I could. \n\n### Post-race\nI was surprised by how UN hungry I was afterwards and although I drank lots of water and had some amazing ramen, I think I should have maybe planned for a delicious smoothie as well, since I ended up feeling kind of off the rest of the day and the day after. Definitely some tired muscles but overall, I feel good and injury-free, so that’s another big goal accomplished!\n\nReflecting back, I think I feel so good about this because I don’t have any regrets. I don’t regret any of the training I did (or any of the training I skipped), I don’t have any regrets about how I ran the race (like I could have tried harder or run faster, etc.) and that’s pretty unusual for me.\n\nMany thanks to organizers and all the volunteers who made Ventura such an awesome experience for this first timer!\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

Having recently bought a shiny new watch, I started up the Garmin beginner half marathon plan with no real goal other than to build a stronger running base. A few weeks in I decided that if I was going to the effort of a 16-week training block I might as well have a race to complete at the end, so after searching around for a fairly small, fairly local race, I entered the Stockport Trail Half.\n\nI had opted for the heart rate version of the Garmin plan, and my biggest hurdle early on was finding a pace I could hold while staying in Z2. I quickly realised that my previous training had been far too fast, so I had to spend a few weeks doing run-walk intervals for my easy runs to build up the low aerobic capacity.\n\nMy training week averaged 35km across 3 runs: easy or tempo; intervals; long run. I supplemented the runs with swimming and indoor cycling, each once or twice a week. The longest run session was 2 hours which took me up to 22km - a real confidence boost going into the race knowing I could do the distance. \n\n### Pre-race\nIn the two days prior to the race I focused on staying hydrated and stocking up on carbs. On race morning it was a 5.30am alarm, a very syrupy porridge breakfast, and then into the car for the 90 min drive to Stockport. I arrived early, which meant no queues for the porta-loos, but a good hour and a half standing around on a none-too-warm February morning. I did a short warm-up jog and some stretching before getting into my starting wave.\n\n### Race\nThe race route sets out on a path along the decommissioned railway line towards Macclesfield, turning around at 10km and joining the canal towpath for the return leg. This meant it was very flat (only 40m total ascent), and although billed as a trail race, the dirt, gravel and cobble surfaces were very manageable in road shoes. \n\nBased on my training runs (where I ran a 48-min 10K, and 22km in 2:08), I'd set myself a pace plan for a 1:50 finish, with negative splits starting at 5:30/km and finishing at 4:54/km. The first 5km felt very easy, and I had to remind myself to stick to the plan while I watched most of my wave go past me within 10 mins of the start. My target splits only dropped by around 3s/km each time, so each increment felt manageable as I warmed up into the race. I brought four 20g carb gels with me, and started taking them at 20 min intervals from 5km onwards.\n\nThe 10km turnaround took me by surprise - if the marshal hadn't been standing in the path, I might have missed the turn entirely! I had planned to reassess at this point, and decide whether to continue aiming for 1:50 or adjust down to 1:55. The legs were still fine and my HR had stayed steady in the mid 160s (my Z3), so I was confident I could keep on with the 1:50 plan. I pushed on along the canal, overtaking where it was safe to do so. The wind was definitely a factor on the return leg, and more than once I took advantage of drafting behind another runner to save some energy.\n\nThe only real mistake of the race came where I misread my watch and thought I had completed 16km (note to self: \"kilometre 16\" means you've done 15, not 16!). I was feeling pretty good and decided to abandon the rest of the pace plan and treat the remaining \"5\" km like a 5K race. With that in mind, I also decided not to take on my final gel because it would slow me down. It took a couple of kms at around 4:50/km pace to realise my mistake, and by then I was committed so I just kept pushing, eventually getting my final kilometre down to 4:35 (only 6s off my actual 5K PB pace!)\n\nI crossed the line for a chip timed finish of 1:48:xx, looking exhausted and ungainly (as confirmed by the finish photos), but more than a minute under my goal time for my first half marathon!\n\n### Post-race\nI definitely didn't stretch or cool down well enough after the race, but I did get possibly the best flapjack I've ever tasted along with my medal at the finish, so still a win in my book. I'm sore today, so plenty of foam rolling and a recovery swim or two before I get back to running again.\n\nI can't get over how well the negative split plan worked. I felt strong throughout, and the psychological boost of passing other runners right up until the finish line can't be underestimated. Now having a baseline HM PB pace, I think I could start my splits slightly faster and do the whole race \"on-plan\", but as a first race based on a guesstimate finish time I'm pretty pleased.\n\nIt was a fantastic first HM experience (and first race in general), and I already have my eye on another HM later this year. For now, though, it's time to shave the legs and prepare the lycra for my first sprint triathlon in 12 weeks...\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "TLDR: **Is resting the foam in your shoes good for increasing total mileage of each individual shoe?**\n\nI wanted to post this type of thread again with [this article in the OP](https://runrepeat.com/uk/guides/running-shoe-foams-guide). I'm not saying this is definitive, the citation is just described as \"a chart made by Dow\". \n\n> In this chart created by the American-based company Dow to showcase the advantages of its EVA + OBC compound, various foams undergo static compression at room temperature for 22 hours. Afterward, they’re set for recovery during 24 hours. If a foam manages to return to its original shape...\n\n> To err on the side of caution, establish a rotation of 2 or 3 pairs of shoes and wait at least 48 hours before using the same model again. And as happens with you, the longer and faster you run, the more rest your shoes will need to recover. By doing so, you'll not only enjoy better leg protection and bounciness, but you'll also extend the lifespan of the shoe by allowing it to fully recover between workouts.\n\n> (Ctrl + F \"Let your shoes rest and recover\" to find this section in the link)\n\nI've seen this question asked a few times, here is the summary of various threads:\n\n- this is not a thing. This answer gets the most upvotes on threads of this topic\n- some people say they do rotate, and seem to get more life\n- about an equal number of anecdotal comments say the opposite (same life)\n\nI want to preclude \"get shoes for different types of runs\" and \"slightly different shoes may help prevent injury by training different muscles\" discussions to focus on the *foam recovery* phenomenon.\n\nI'm one month in and already have 3 shoes even though all I ever do at this stage of running is \"easy days\", so the facts aren't all that important to me. I'm keeping these shoes regardless lol I just am curious",

It lets the mods group posts into Collections.  We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users.  We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed.  Here's the link to the wiki with a list of the current Collections.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/collections/\n\nPlease note, Collections only works for New Reddit and the Reddit mobile app for iOS.\n\n\n\n__________\n\n###**Using r/running**\n\n\n\nThe mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*\n\nThe mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.\n\nRegardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.\n\nWe are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.\n\n_____\n\n\n###**Recurring Threads**\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).\n\nHere are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  \n\n*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by \"Hot\" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by \"New\" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*\n\n* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!\n\n* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.\n\n* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c98s02/the_weekly_training_thread/)\n\n* [Miscellaneous Monday General Chit-Chat (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1caaly7/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat/)\n\n* [Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1ca1bgm/lil_race_report_thread/)\n\n* [Super Moronic Monday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cb231e/super_moronic_monday_your_weekly_tuesday_stupid/)\n\n* [Run Nutrition Tuesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cav89s/run_nutrition_tuesday/)\n\n* [Tuesday Shoesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cav89d/tuesday_shoesday/)\n\n* [Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c60e28/lurkers_wednesday/)\n\n* [What Are You Wearing Wednesday Weekly Gear Thread (Wednesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c60e2d/what_are_you_wearing_wednesday_weekly_gear_thread/)\n\n* [Weekly Complaints & Confessions Thread (Thursdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c72m6l/weekly_complaints_confessions_thread/)\n\n* [Photo Friday (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c7y86w/its_photo_friday_lets_see_your_running_pictures/)\n\n* [The Weekend Thread (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c7v50k/the_weekend_thread_19th_april_2024/)\n\n* [Race Roll Call (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c7njjb/race_roll_call/)\n\n* [Social Saturday (Saturdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1c8go1l/social_saturday/)\n\n* [Monthly Updates & Check In Thread (First Day of the Month)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1b3n3ln/february_monthly_updates_check_in_thread/)\n_____\n\n###**Rules**\nWe have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.\n\n **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  \n\nThis sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.\n\nIf you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Current MPW + pace\n\n* Previous peak MPW\n\n* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed\n\n* Goals (including specific races)\n\n* Previous PRs\n\n* Other things you think might be helpful to include\n\nBelow are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:\n\n* \"Does anyone else...\" type posts?\n\n* \"Is X a good time for...?\" posts\n\n* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).\n\n* If your question can be asked in one sentence.\n\n* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.\n\n* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.\n\n* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  \n\n* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.\n\nFinally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.\n\n **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  \n\nWhile there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  \n\nThere is a big difference between \"Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?\" and \"My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?\" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.\n\nAlso, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.\n\n_____________________\n\n\nFinally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.\n\n###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**"

        "Texto": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Mesa Marathon\n* **Date:** February 10, 2024\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Mesa, AZ\n* **Website:** https://mesamarathon.com/\n* **Time:** 4:13\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | The Usual* | *Yes* |\n| B | 4:22 (10min/mi pace) | *Yes* |\n| C | 4:00??? | *No* |\n\n### Training\nI followed Hal Higdon's [Intermediate 2](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-2-marathon/) plan for my race. I'd been running consistently for about a year when I started and was averaging 20ish mpw over 4 days of running a week. I was worried it might be a bit ambitious but it mostly went ok, more on that in a second. I skipped the last 10/20 pair because of a family wedding (no regrets) and missed the occasional run due to whatever illness my toddler brought home from daycare. Overall I hit 530 of the 600ish total miles the plan calls for. Almost every run was done solo before anyone else in the house was up, so major kudos to my Noxgear vest for keeping me alive. No training injuries and lots of miles meant a few new pairs of shoes!\n\nTo anyone thinking about doing this plan: I'd strongly encourage you to be at 25mpw before jumping in, and extra strongly encourage you to be already running 5 days a week. 20mpw at 4x a week was not as strong of a starting point for this plan as I hoped. This is not a great plan if you have never run a marathon before or if you have an aggressive time goal. There's no \"speed work\" where speed = faster than race pace. The closest you get is every other week doing some miles at race pace.\n\nExperimented a lot with food/hydration to find what works, and even got myself eating before my long runs despite the already-early alarm clock.\n\n### Pre-race\nI ran the half last year so I knew what to expect for logistics. Spoiler alert: they're a nightmare the morning of. Packet pickup was fine on Friday. 3:30am alarm for Saturday, was out the door by 4:10 with toast/PB/banana and coffee taken care of. I even remembered my thrift store discard clothes! The normally 15 minute drive took me an hour (50 minutes to go the last half mile and find a parking spot). Used the port-a-potty before getting in the marathon bus line where I spent 20 minutes standing in the drizzle kindly telling half-marathoners they were in the wrong bus line before they got more busses to arrive. Got on the bus and arrived at the start line 15 minutes before the scheduled 6:30 start.\n\n6:25 - They announce a new start time of 7:00 due to traffic/weather. Not ideal because of drizzle and temps in the low 40s, but whatever.\n6:45 - National anthem\n6:47ish - They announce a new start time of 6:50. This caused some chaos but I managed to ditch my sweats and get to the start line.\n\n### Race\n6:52 I was off. The first half is downhill except for miles 4 to 5.25. I stayed with the 4:05 pace group to take advantage of the downhill without going too fast, but they slowed down more than I was happy with for the climb so I went on ahead (big mistake). I cruised through the first 14 miles feeling really good about myself and wondering if I had it in me to do sub-4. Crossed the half at 2:00:33 which was a big clue that sub-4 wasn't likely, but I wasn't ready to accept it based on how well the race was going for me. Drizzled for the first few miles but let up and got nice for a while.\n\nStarted raining/drizzling at or shortly after the halfway mark, and at mile 15 my hips started to feel tight. I was atrocious about stretching and strength training and was paying for it. Kept doing ok until mile 20 where I hit a wall. Mostly physical but was not in a great place mentally either. Managed to do the last 10k where at some point I realized that besides the hip aches, lack of muscle energy, and wet socks/shoes I had also started chafing under my shirt. Everyone who should have clearly noticed was gracious enough to not say anything. I'll just say that I won't be getting any race photos printed. Made it across the finish line at 4:12:59 feeling absolutely awful. My brain and body were both in places they'd never been before.\n\n### Post-race\nLimped through the finisher area and grabbed chocolate milk, a banana, some water, and a granola bar. Found my wife and kid and semi-collapsed into them sobbing. Limped around the muddy finish area for a few minutes because I was afraid to sit, then got home and took the most incredible hot shower I think I've ever taken. Surprisingly few blisters. Spent the rest of the day with a toddler who didn't understand why I couldn't pick them up or crouch down to play with them, and turned in early. I'm mostly physically recovered by now, just a few small aches and pains.\n\nI'm very proud of a few things:\n-Being really consistent with the training plan\n-Finishing!\n-Sticking to my \"Gu every 4 miles\" plan and getting fluids at every aid station\n-Meeting my original goal of an average pace below 10:00min/mi\n-How I felt for the first half. I'll be chasing that feeling for a while.\n\nI had some learning moments too:\n-Feeling good on the downhill first half and assuming that means a good second half is a fool's errand for a new runner\n-I was not ready psychologically for the back half, especially miles 20-26.2\n-This wasn't a super first marathon, course-wise. Not particularly scenic and not a lot of spectators (also lots of roads shared with cars, but I knew that from the half). You won't get a lot of boost from the environment at this race.\n\nWill do it again? A marathon seems likely, at least to do one in better weather, but the Mesa Marathon? Eh. I'm not sold that the convenience of a short drive was worth everything else that happened (both in and out of the organizer's control).\n\nWhat's next? A trail 40k in April because I'm the fool who signed up for that before the marathon. At least it will be prettier!\n\n*I should clarify my \"The Usual\" goal comment. I've been doing trail races the past year and my partner and I have a joke that goal number one is always don't get hurt. Goal 2 has always been 'finish' and goal 3 has always been 'have fun'. I've combined these into one standing \"Usual Goal\" for all my races.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph."

        "Texto": "David Goggins is an interesting personality. From my perspective, he's one of those figures you either love or hate. I'm impressed by his perseverance and drive, but his life and fitness philosophy don't appeal to me much. I guess my attitude resonates more with \"zen-like\" runners, such as Anton Krupicka, Scott Jurek, or Eliud Kipchoge. Goggins' bestseller, \"Can't Hurt Me,\" sits on my library shelf, but the bookmark is stuck somewhere in the middle. Sadly, I have no intention of advancing in the lecture.\n\nStill, the idea of completing the infamous David Goggins challenge has always appealed to me. Despite my lukewarm approach toward its inventor, the challenge offers a unique way to try oneself in a different running \"dimension.\" The challenge is simple: run 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) every 4 hours, across 48 hours. This means going for a run, resting for about three hours (the four-hour difference is counted between the start of each run), rinse, and repeat. No matter the time of day or weather. Fun fact: when you do the math, the challenge is the equivalent of running almost two marathons within two days.\n\nI've been toying with the idea of completing the David Goggins challenge for several months now. Finally, November 2023 gave me a great opportunity to take it up. The preceding month, October, was pretty hectic. I finished the Berlin marathon (you can read my running report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/16rpyom/bmw_berlin_marathon32517just_keeping_on_pounding/)) and climbed Kilimanjaro a week later. In late November, I was well-rested and eager for a new challenge – something grandiose yet doable. Ideally something I could take up just a stone's throw from my apartment. Perfect time for the David Goggins Challenge.\n\n## Preparation\n\nOver the years, I've learned that preparations for any type of physical challenge are important. Equally crucial, however, is keeping it simple and concise. So, I spent one afternoon writing down the plan and getting myself ready:\n\n* Conducted short research on Reddit to learn how [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/t0q0wj/doing_david_goggins_4x4x48_challenge_need_some/) approached the challenge.\n* Allocated 48 hours solely for David's challenge, daily chores, and rest while watching two series simultaneously: \"Jazz\" by Ken Burns and HBO's \"Rome\" (rewatching it after more than a decade; still stands out as one of my favorite series ever).\n* Bought snacks, fruits, and, most importantly, ingredients to prepare eight large servings of spaghetti carbonara—my favorite running food. Full of carbs and protein, easy to prepare and digest.\n* Wrote down my schedule in Notion and set up a series of alarms on my Garmin accordingly.\n* Moved to a separate room, sparing my fiancée the burden of being woken up twice every night for two consecutive days.\n* Prepared three sets of running clothes in advance, including a waterproof Goretex jacket, a headlamp for night runs, headphones, etc. It's crucial, especially at night, not to waste time looking for fresh clothes (as it deduces minutes from the sleep time).\n\n## The Challenge: The Subjective\n\nContrary to what I read before completing the challenge, it is not as hardcore as Goggins himself. The runs themselves are not physically brutal. I think that 4 miles is a very forgiving distance, even when completed repeatedly, a dozen times. I may have had the advantage of always making sure that I got at least some sleep at night, as well as taking care of nutrition (hail carbonara!). Quite honestly, the most difficult part was waking up at night, getting dressed, and jogging into the darkness. This was especially problematic during the second night of the challenge. Running at night, soaking wet, through the empty park made me truly appreciate the day runs. The first 8:00 am run in the sun after three days of running in the dark was glorious.\n\nIn hindsight, one thing that I should have done is stretch more. As I mentioned before, the physical load your body has to bear is equivalent to two marathons. My constantly stiff (yet not painful) legs were begging for a stretching and rolling session. Also, at the end of the last few runs, my back and shoulders got super stiff and started to hurt a bit. But I was too busy eating or doing daily chores to properly take care of my muscles (David Goggins: were you too busy, or are you making up excuses, boy? Me: you're probably right, David, I am a mere slave trapped in the cage made of excuses).\n\n## The Challenge: The Objective\n\nAfter completing the challenge, I was super eager to pull the data from my Garmin and see what the data reveals about my runs. Surprisingly, this is not a trivial task. Initially, <u>I thought that every workout tracked by Garmin was being saved locally on my watch, but this is so not true</u>! To retrieve your data as files, you need to first sync your device and send the data to Garmin servers through Garmin Express. Only then, using [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com), can you download a `.csv` data summary of your workouts from the website - but this data is super limited!\n\nContrary to what you might expect, the workouts cannot be fully pulled locally from the watch. Well, you know how the saying goes: \"not your key, not your coin\"; I'd say \"yes, your watch, but no, not your data.\" To get your hands on your `.fit` workout files, you need to explicitly ask Garmin to share them with you. This takes a few hours up to a few days until you receive an email message from the company with the link to your data. Only then, using some open-source libraries such as [fitdecode](https://github.com/polyvertex/fitdecode) or [fitparse](https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse), may you attempt to parse out the data that interests you and start gaining some insight from it. I built a small [script](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed-blog-codes/blob/master/kipchoge/kipchoge.py) that takes a set of `.fit` files from my running workouts and converts them into a human-readable dataframe.\n\nNote: In theory, `.fit` files should be exhaustive and contain all the information that your Garmin watch has access to. Sadly, I couldn't find some crucial information such as the number of calories burned, training load, or dehydration level. I know that Garmin does store them somewhere since I can find them (and many, many more items) in my Garmin Connect mobile app dashboards. Nevertheless, I managed to pull out crucial data about my run and inspect it using [this simple notebook](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed-blog-codes/blob/master/kipchoge/analysis.ipynb).\n\n(yeah, this write-up is also intended who people who can code :))\n\n[Diagram 1](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed.github.io/blob/master/assets/18/4.png)\n\nEach of the twelfth inclined red lines represents a distance of 4 miles (6.5 km). Between the start of each run, there are 4-hour gaps. As demonstrated by the chart, my first run started on 11/22/23 at 19:00, and the challenge was finished with the final run at 16:00 on 11/24/23. To compute the average pace, I converted the speed from default units (meters per second) to runner-readable pace (minutes per kilometer). It turns out that my pace was not steady at all, as it would be if I were running a marathon, for example. I was having fun: going faster when I felt like it or slowing down. This amounted to an average pace of around 6 min/km, indicating that every 4-mile run took me around 40 minutes.\n\n[Diagram 2](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed.github.io/blob/master/assets/18/5.png?raw=true)\n\nThe heart rate also reflects the fact that I was running \"by feeling.\" The data shows that during the challenge, my minimal heart rate was 76 bpm, my average heart rate was 150 bpm, and my max heart rate was 180 bpm. These are very plausible and non-surprising numbers. An interesting fact: the further in I am in the challenge, the bigger the variance in speed/heart rate. It clearly shows that I was much more fatigued, unfocused, and rather dragging my body than running in a composed manner.\n\n[Diagram 3](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed.github.io/blob/master/assets/18/6.png?raw=true)\n\nAnother piece of data being saved is the latitude and longitude information from the built-in GPS. Funny enough, by default, Garmin saves latitude and longitude in the [obscure \"semicircle\" units](https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/f/discussion/298963/retrieving-position-location-coordinates-in-semicircles-units-not-possible). Not sure what the use case for this representation is, so converted semicircles to degrees. So now, it is clear that I was located roughly at `51°N 17°E` at the time of the run (which you can check by looking those coordinates up).\n\nThat's all the valuable information that I was able to get from my Garmin `.fit` files for this challenge. I managed to pull information about the running cadence or running power, but that's not really interesting. It's a shame; we know for a fact that Garmin collects tons and tons of items, even most exotic data, like estimated sweat loss.\n\nIn summary, completing the David Goggins Challenge provided a unique and demanding experience. The subjective aspects highlighted physical challenges, especially during nighttime runs, while the objective (sparse) data from my Garmin revealed insights about my pace or heart rate. The overall experience was enlightening and rewarding, showcasing the intersection of physical and mental endurance.\n\nI also shared this report on my [website](https://dtransposed.github.io/blog/2024/02/07/David-Goggings-Challenge/)."

Yes, literally every single day since then I have done something. On most of those days I tried to at least do 30 minutes on the treadmill or at least 3 miles outside if the conditions and my mood allowed. Over time I've been increasing the daily mileage to where it is around 4.5 miles a day. My long runs are typically 10Ks which get done on weekends or when I attend Atlanta Run Club on Monday evenings. Overall I wouldn't say I had the most optimal training but when I began running everyday my PB was around 28 minutes or so for the 5K although I will admit I had never truly pushed myself to see what my fastest is.\n\n**Pre-Race:**\n\nThe race took place at 8am so pre race I woke up around 6:15 and laid in bed a bit wondering if I really wanted to do this. After deciding yes I through my leggings and pullover on due to it being a cold 40 degree morning and then proceeded to decide what shoes I was going to wear. It was between the Nike Streakfly which is supposed to be purpose built for 5Ks or the Prime X 2 Strung which I got maybe a month ago and has become my favorite shoe to run in. I ultimately decided on the Prime X 2 Strung and headed out the door. I drove to the nearest MARTA Station (Atlanta's public transit) and rode the train to the location of the race. I arrived at the race sit at maybe 7:20ish or so and waited in line to go through the metal detectors to be let into the venue and go to the table to pickup my bib.\n\n**Race:**\n\nAfter waiting for everyone to get pictures with the Atlanta Hawks mascot Harry the Hawk and the national anthem to play we were off at 8:02 am and running. I'm not sure how it was decided but I was in A wave so in the initial group that was let go although I hung towards the back since I had no intentions of trying to to win this race. The beginning of the race went pretty well, I was running at a fairly comfortable pace albeit faster than I was expecting. I'm not sure if that was just do to the crowd of people running to through the streets with me dragging me along or the excitement of my first race. Around maybe a half mile  or so the first uphill sections (Atlanta, really the entire region of Georgia is very hilly) began and people began to dial it back and slow down. Foolishly I continued to chug on and just stride up and down the hills of the streets of Atlanta. At around the 2 mile mark the longest 2 climbs of the race began, the first was not a very steep climb but it was a fairly long climb running towards the Mercedes Benz Stadium. The race then hung a right and we proceeded to have to go up a long and relatively steep climb. This is around the time I began to burn out and slowed significantly. Up until that point I had run a 7:48 first mile and 7:40 second mile. By the time I finished those climbs about .15-.2 miles before the 3 mile marker my pace had slowed into the 8 minutes. All told mile 3 was an 8:26 mile. Finishing up I came down the hill back towards the starting line and finished as strong as I could for the last .1 of the race I had a 7:59 pace (lol) and I crossed the line in an unofficial bib time of 24:43.\n\n**Post Race:**\n\nI proudly looked at my watch and saw that not only had I gotten to my 25 minute goal (earlier in the week I had set a PB of 25:23) I had beaten it by nearly 20 seconds. I then went to get my complimentary chick fil a biscuit, smoothie king smoothie, bottle or water, and race t shirt and headed back to the train station with a lot of pride in myself. Upon getting back home I took a like 3 hour nap and woke up ravenously hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall it was a very fun experience and I've already signed up for a 10k in march and plan on doing the Peachtree Road Race and PNC 10 Miler later this year as well as possibly the Thanksgiving half marathon on Thanksgiving day due to this first race experience. Anyway, thanks for reading.",

Back then, it was my first year of college, and I was a pretty active/athletic guy, so I did minimal training – maybe running a 5k or 10k once a week for a handful of weeks leading up to the race. Ran the race and ended up totally messing up my knee, finally stopping at mile 10 and dragging through the last 3 miles with watery eyes as I fought through the pain. Finished in 2:39, by far the longest distance I had ever done. Couldn’t really run the next few months as I rehabbed my knee, and eventually fell into that group of folks that only run once a year in a Turkey Trot 5k. Fast forward 9 years to this past December, my friend and I signed up for the same half-marathon, with intention of doing a full marathon later. I was determined to redeem myself at Surf City.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Training**\n\nWe followed Hal Higdon’s novice plan, and I invested in some good running shoes (Novablast 4) and an Apple Watch so I wouldn’t have to carry my phone all the time. We didn’t really know what our easy/moderate/race paces were, so we just ran miles and would regularly check how we felt. Our “easy” pace was about 10 min/mi, and we figured with enough training, we could set our “race pace” goal to be around 9:10 min/mi to get to the 2-hour mark for the HM. That first month, I was in a rhythm and my body felt good enough to push for longer periods of time. Sub-2 was looking very possible.\r  \n\rHowever, second week of January, I developed shin splints. I was in the middle of a run, and the pain was so bad that I could barely walk back to my car. I did all the research I could to recover my shins quickly, as the race now less than one month away. I took a week to recover and became more intentional with stretching/warming up before runs, my cadence/form during runs, and icing/rolling out after runs. Slowly got back into my training for three weeks, and I was feeling rested and fresh going into the weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pre-Race**\n\nThe race was slated to start at 7:45am, and I didn’t fall asleep the night before until around 11:00pm, waking up at 4:45. Pre-race jitters. I stretched out, ate toast with peanut butter, and we drove 10 mins from our hotel to the drop-off point and got to the start area at about 7:10am. Waited in line for 20 mins for a porta potty, so I used that time to warm up. We squeezed ourselves into the crowded corral about 5 mins before the start and waited until our wave was let loose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Race**\n\nMiles 1-3: My goal pace was 9:09 to get the 2-hour HM time. I remembered all the posts/articles I read on the importance of starting out slow to get your body warmed up. Naturally, it’s pretty crowded the first mile or two, so it’s hard to go fast. I stayed on the edge and tried to go at what felt like an easy pace. Looked down at my watch after the first mile and saw I was at 9:21, much faster than I felt like I was going, but my legs and lungs felt good, so I went with it.\r  \nMiles 4-7: I started to settle in. At this point, I started taking Honey Stinger chews (tried Gu gels when training but could not keep those down comfortably while running), popping a couple every 1.5 to 2 miles. I was stopping at most of the water stations, walking for 5-10 steps to sip before getting back into pace. This portion of the race felt really good. I looked down at my watch and realized that I could probably get a 1:55, which got me really excited to just keep this going as long as I could.\r  \nMiles 8-10: Got stomach cramps halfway through mile 8. This slowed me down a little, but I just told myself to ignore the pain and focus on my breathing. The cramps subsided after about 5 minutes but would come back in waves. Started to slow down here, but I was still well on pace to get sub-2, so I kept trucking on.\r  \nMiles 11-13: Bonk. This was the toughest 3 miles I think I’ve ever done. My pace drastically slowed down. Tried taking more chews, but even chewing was getting tiresome. The group of people I was keeping up with were now way ahead of me as more and more people jogged past me. I honestly didn’t think I was going to be able to finish; a lot of negotiation with myself, and definitely the most mentally challenging part. Halfway through the 12th mile, I decided to walk for 1 minute. I wanted to finish the race strong and thought a quick break would give me enough energy to push through the last 1.5 miles. Goal B was failed, but looking back at it, I did what I felt my body needed, so I’m okay with that. The last mile sucked, but I saw my wife and some friends about 0.5 miles from the finish cheering me on, and that gave me the boost to sprint out the rest of the way. Checked my watch when I crossed the line, and I was under 2 hours with some time to spare. \r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Post-Race**\n\nI wanted to fall on the ground and lay down immediately after finishing, but I also wanted some water and fuel. Grabbed a couple water bottles, some protein bars, and a banana. Found my friend to congratulate him on his finish, and we met up with our wives for hugs, pictures, and support to walk to the car. My legs were sore, but no knee or shin pain, so that was a win. Looking back at the race, even though I had to walk for a little bit of it, I’m proud I was able to redeem my-18-year-old-self and go 40 minutes faster. Next up is the OC Marathon in May! I think that one will be a “just finish” type of race for me. 😊\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a first-time experience for me – intentionally training for a race – so any words of advice would be appreciated as I look to the full marathon, and hopefully many more races."

My main reasoning was to have a specific goal work towards. I didn't use a specific training plan and was pretty inconsistent early on, but by December I was averaging about 15-20 miles/week, easy pace 11:00-11:30, hard 9:00-9:30. My goal was to build distance early on (for my own peace of mind). I had been running 10 mile long runs semi-regularly since September. 3 weeks out, I peaked at 27miles or so with my longest run being 11 miles with a 10:30 pace. \n\nI ran my long runs with a vest and a small flask of water (with a lil sea salt). I trained with both honey packets and fruit smoothie honey stinger gels on long runs, typically taking one or the other every 5 miles when running over 1:45 total.\n\nI didn't focus on time much while training, it wasn't a priority. While training I worried about maintaining pace and not being completely derailed by my competitive (to a fault) tendencies. 10:30 pace or so ended up being a natural favorite, that I ran many of my runs at. It was the pace my body settled into without watching my watch so I figured it would serve as a good standard to aim for on race day.\n\n2 weeks out from the race I injured my right calf while transitioning (poorly) to new shoes. Probably some sort of soleus strain, it affected my ability to push off while running and walking. Both legs were affected, but right is worse. It gets better after moving and worse after a period of resting. I saw the doctor and rested per advice. Because of this I pretty much did not taper at all and ran about 8 miles total in the last 2 weeks. I honestly considered not racing because I was worried I would hurt my leg further and/or not finish. 4 days out from race day and I ran a test run, 4 miles at race pace and at the end I felt great and decided to go ahead and try. I hoped to run about a 2:20 at first but the week before i readjusted my expectations and decided finishing was all i needed.\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nMorning of the race I felt insanely excited! Woke up at 6, ate some peanut butter oats and started stretching. My legs were pretty tight so i knew i needed to focus on getting everything nice and warm. I was still debating wearing a vest and bringing a water bottle as I had been for all my long runs but ultimately settled for my spi belt and taping my gels to the inside of my sports bra (genius). I left plenty early around 7:30 and jogged / skipped / hopped my way to the start line. Got there around 8am and felt late. Stood in line for the bathroom at a gas station for 30 minutes and then frantically found my way to my group. The energy was great, there were so many people, and I did my best to stay warm and moving until start time.\n\n**Race**\n\nAt 9 am first wave took off. Once my group (the last one, #6) finally made it to the start line I spotted my friends cheering from the side and this definitely helped set the tone. My main goal was to go out SLOW which I managed with 10:30 being a comfortable long run pace that I'd practiced. I immediately noticed that my HR was significantly higher than usual from the gate so spent a while worrying about that. My heart rate regularly runs a lot higher than most benchmarks I see but this was unusual, especially for such a comfortable pace. It wasn't particularly obvious that it was so high either, if I hadn't been paying close attention I might not have noticed.\n\nMiles 1-5 were definitely hard but I was prepared for that feeling and I knew I would find my groove. I was a little worried I was running too fast because of my HR but it felt sustainable so I pushed on. The course was beautiful and familiar which was a nice combo for kind of zoning out. It was also flat (as advertised) and pretty straightforward. I took a gel around mile 5 and grabbed sips of water/powerade from the (well supplied) stations every 5k. I was glad I didn't take my vest as it was nice feeling so light and there were luckily no mishaps getting hydration. I was surprised at how natural it felt to maintain such a consistent pace, i followed pace buddies when possible but let my body decide when to push past and when to let them go.\n\nMiles 6-10 were incredible as predicted- I passed my friends on the sidelines again and was FLOATING. Honestly just felt so excited to be running again. I took my second gel at mile 10 along with a full cup of powerade, very quickly (too quickly?). At mile 11 my vision got a little foggy and my music started sounding distant and I suddenly realized I was lightheaded and immediately panicked (passing out is a big fear of mine). I quickly slowed to a walk and focused on my breathing, scoping out a spot to sit down if I needed. My heart rate was too high here. After about 20 seconds, I felt better and started to jog again, slower and paying closer attention to my watch. Miles 11-12 I was genuinely worried I wouldn't finish and anxiously checking my pulse. My body and legs felt great (mostly because I couldn't really feel them) but I was stressed about passing out which is not a normal feeling for me nor an issue I anticipated. We passed under the setas landmark and by the beautiful cathedral and I just focused on the feeling of crossing the line. I didn't want to push too hard and risk it even though it weirdly felt like I had plenty of gas in the tank, but at .10 left I opened up for the final stretch. The streets were wide and shaded at the end which was a welcome relief from the tight cobblestone streets of miles 11-12. The board read 2:19:xx as I crossed and I was ecstatic.\n\n**Post-race**\n\n After crossing the line I felt like sobbing- I was overwhelmed physically and mentally and finishing was just like this incredible wave of catharsis. I found my friends and sipped on a (free) beer while we made our way home (remembered to stop my watch here). Once the endorphins wore off my legs definitely began hurting. I should have spent more time stretching right after. 3 days out now and I'm feeling better. I'm going to give my legs plenty of rest before I get back out there again. They need it. I'm very proud of my time- it's a time I hadn't considered feasible at any point in my training :) Already looking to find my next race!\n\nGoing forward I'd like to include more strength training to hopefully prevent future injury and help round out my leg muscles so that switching shoes in the future isn't so devastating."
